Do animals see colours?   It actually depends on the animal!\n\nThe eye consists of Rods and Cones.  Rods handle detail.  They are the most sensitive. That is why cats can see intricate detail, such as the predicted direction of the jumping of a mouse due to muscle twitches, than to if the mouse is white, black or orange.  Cones handle colors.\n\nSee the source for better definition\n\nOn a side note... visible light is just a small part of the electomagnetic spectrum.  Some animals can see infrared, but are blind to purples, while others cant see red, but see ultraviolet light!
Is a Nevada corporation really that much better than a colorado or utah corporation? I understand that Nevada corps have more privacy built into them, and that one can utilize a charging order if you get sued, and basically continue to control the asset.  \n\nIs that reason enough to go with a Nevada Corporation or LLC when owning real estate? It is and it is why more Nevada and Delaware corporations exist than any other state. The only place to gain more privacy and even more pro-business leverage is from the country of Panama.
Which was the worst earthquake to hit ever? (1) On the recorded richter scale\n(2) By the level of devastation There are, of course, different ways to define "worst". It could be the most property damage, most loss of life, most powerful at its focus (the actual origin of the quake), or most powerful at its epicenter (the place on the Earth directly above the focus).\n\nPrior to recent times, no one had accurate instruments to measure energy released in an earthquake, and no one kept accurate records of damage. The longer ago an earthquake occurred, and the less developed the area where it occurred, the less we know about it. Information regarding after shocks and duration is usually not available.\n\nGood sources for information are:\n\nhttp://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/neis/eqlists/eqsmosde/html or\nhttp://www.usgs.gov and click on “Earthquake.”\n\nAccording to them (the U.S. Geological Survey National Earthquake Information Center)\n\nMost Destructive Known Earthquakes on Record in the World\n                         (50,000 deaths or more)\n             (Listed in order of greatest number of deaths)\n\n\nDate               Location            Deaths    Mag    Comments\n\nJanuary 23, 1556   China, Shansi       830,000 \n\nOctober 11, 1737   India, Calcutta**   300,000\n\nJuly 27, 1976      China, Tangshan     255,000*  8.0\n\nAugust 9, 1138     Syria, Aleppo       230,000\n\nMay 22, 1927       China, near Xining  200,000   8.3  Large fractures.\n\nDecember 22, 856+  Iran, Damghan       200,000\n\nDecember 16, 1920  China, Gansu        200,000   8.6  Major fractures,\n                                                      landslides.\n\nMarch 23, 893+     Iran, Ardabil       150,000\n\nSeptember 1, 1923  Japan, Kwanto       143,000   8.3  Great Tokyo fire.\n\nOctober 5, 1948    USSR                110,000   7.3\n   (Turkmenistan, Ashgabat)\n\nDecember 28, 1908  Italy, Messina       70,000   7.5  Deaths from \n                                    to 100,000        earthquake and \n                                    (estimated)       tsunami.\n    \nSeptember, 1290    China, Chihli       100,000 \n\nNovember, 1667     Caucasia, Shemakha   80,000\n\nNovember 18, 1727  Iran, Tabriz         77,000\n\nNovember 1, 1755   Portugal, Lisbon     70,000   8.7  Great tsunami.\n\nDecember 25, 1932  China, Gansu         70,000   7.6\n\nMay 31, 1970       Peru                 66,000   7.8  $530,000 damage,\n                                                      great rock slide,\n                                                      floods.\n\n    1268           Asia Minor, Silicia  60,000\n\nJanuary 11, 1693   Italy, Sicily        60,000\n\nMay 30, 1935       Pakistan, Quetta     30,000   7.5  Quetta almost\n                                     to 60,000        completely destroyed.\n\nFebruary 4, 1783   Italy, Calabria      50,000\n\nJune 20, 1990      Iran                 50,000   7.7  Landslides.\n\n* Official casualty figure--estimated death toll as high as 655,000.\n+ Note that these dates are prior to 1000 AD.

Network Attached Server (NAS Server)? Hi, I would like to buy a NAS Server for home use. The options are from Buffallo Tech, Western Digital and Tritton Tech. I don't know which one to buy for what I need.\nI need to store photos, videos, datas, music, and possibly to run as FTP+HTTP server(using dyns)so people can access there and view the website and files without having my pc ON. \nI want it to work just attaching to router or Cable Modem. Thanks Actually NAS is better known as Network Attached Storage. I currently use a 160GB Buffalo LinkStation and found it extremely easy to configure and use on a day-to-day basis.\n\nThe LinkStation is a network-attached storage device, but it also includes a print server, attachable via one of its two USB ports, and it creates a shared folder for use by anyone on your network. You can use the other USB port to attach an additional drive, but you have to format it with the LinkStation first.\n\nDisk performance is limited by the network. 100 megabits per second (which is only a quarter of the raw capability of USB 2.0) so almost all of the other devices that I looked at outperformed the LinkStation handily. But the convenience of having disk storage available to all of your PCs makes the slower speed bearable. Buffalo does not currently provide centralized backup software for the LinkStation, but I had no problem scheduling and initiating backups from individual PCs using Windows Backup. The network connection was more than adequate for streaming music, even to multiple PCs.\n\nI referenced the following sites when I was trying to make my choice\n\nhttp://www.pcmag.com/category2/0,1874,677853,00.asp\nhttp://reviews-zdnet.com.com/Buffalo_LinkStation_120GB/4505-3382_16-30639593.html\nhttp://www.tomsnetworking.com/Reviews-207-ProdID-HDHG250LAN.php

is marijuna legal in amsterdam?   Having traveled to Amsterdam about four times I can tell you the scoop.  Marijuana is legal however most people there try not to glamorize it so dont attempt to just pull a joint and smoke up in some of the bars and restaurants around Dam Square.  However they have cafe's  or they are called "coffee shops"  Go in there, you can order green tea (most have no alcohol) and then ask for the weed menu.  On this menu it gives you the rundown on all the varieties they sell at the bar.  Some bars even have a small sample attached so you can smell it.  When you decide what you want just order it.  You can walk the streets while smoking a joint, just dont go puffing into businesses like grocery stores to the front desk of the hotel.  Imagine you live in a society where nobody can smoke indoors (imagine you live in California) just dont smoke inside.  However I smoked a lot in the hotel.  \n\nMushrooms... sorry they closed the shops just this year.  You cant get dry mushrooms anymore, however ask about wet mushrooms, but I believe they went away too.  \n\nCrack, coke, lsd, the worx.  You can get them in dam square just hang around the statues at night, you will see dirty looking people, they can get you pretty much everything.  Just dont eat the stuff out of thier bottle.  I think its dirty dirty meth...  I just guessed, but im not into the hard hard stuff.  just and FYI...
Here is a hard riddle? A tractor always gives hayrides a 9:00. It is on an island. Whow did the tractor get on the island if it wasn't built there and there is no bridge? Either on a ferry OR it was brought there when the lake was frozen in the winter season.
how much dose it cost to run a pc for 24 7?   It probably costs about 10 cents per kilowatt-hour to run a PC 24/7, depending where you live.  Most electronic gear is labeled with the power requirements in watts.  Just multiply that by 24 to get the watts per day and divide by 1,000 to get kilowatts.  For example, a 100 watt load times one hour equals 100 watt-hours and multiplied by 24 hours equals 2,400 watt-hours per day.  Dividing 2,400 watt-hours by 1,000 equals 2.4 KW-hours (kilowatt-hours) per day.  This would cost 2.4 time 10 cents or about 24 cents.  Of course, the PC and the monitor each need to be calculated separately.  Also, if the PC is not in constant use it may go into "sleep mode" reducing the power drain.  I read that some people never shut off their PC's because re-starting them may subject the chips to frequent power surges reducing chip life.  In the winter, I consider that the power consumed by my PC helps heat the house.  What is the difference between a 1,000 watt electrical load such as the cooking range vs a 1,000 watt electric heater?  Only the location.  Good luck.

How to play basketball better? I want to know how to be trained Get the fundamentals down first.  Some of the simplest things people forget.  Don't look down when you dribble.  Deliver a 2 hand chest or bounce pass.  Set picks, roll off the screen, etc etc.  \n\nJust goto your local parks and get in a pickup game.  If they're all heads and shoulders better than you, good.  That's the only way you'll get better.  You need to play with people who are better than you.  Good luck.
I want to leave the tech industry. What new career should I choose? I have ten years tech experience developing software, firmware, and hardware. I have spent 7 years dealing with customers in the field. I have an MCSE and I am completing my Bachelor of Business Administration at the end of this month. I feel that you should first look at what you really want to do and what industry/field you'd want to be in. Like how someone said, "When you take up something you like, you'd never have to work for another day in your life".\n\nKnow what your passion is first.

why does weight training build bone mass?   IMO this is one of the ways our body is built to be adaptive.  For people who are exposed to a constant need to lift heavy objects, the body sends a message to the bone cells to add more bone to handle the extra demand that they will need.\n\nAnother example of this adaptivity is modifying the metabolism to use fewer calories when experiencing a famine and keeping this change after the famine ends.\n\nUnfortunately for us modern folk who never experience famine unless we are dieting, this makes losing weight even harder!

How would u find out whether a device is acting as a host or a router using an SNMP command?   Mind you that many hosts (e.g. workstation, laptop) do have multiple network interfaces and could technically act as a router.\n\nIn that case if you are an authorized SNMP manager, you can try to view the machine's ipRouteTable (more on that see http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2096.html.)  The table's content would tell you if this machine is configured to route/forward IP packets, hence acting as a router.

Why is having females in the military a good thing?   the question is too simple... there are pros and cons.  i think it is great to afford women in this country as many of the same opportunities to serve as we can.  but i do think there are some differences that we as a society must be ready to accept if they are going to be on the front lines.  it was hard for americans to see the desecrated bodies of american soldiers in mogadishu-dragged by the locals-how hard will that image be when its a woman? i will agree that women can be as aggressive and intelligent as men when called on to fight. i have seen a lot of impressive things from women troopers-ladies who can keep up with me on a march, and i'm not slow. who can shoot as well as me- and i shhot excellently. but combat involves a lot of "hurryup and wait" and boredom sets in...if i was in a foxhole with a female for days waiting for an attack that might never come, what happens when things get sexually heavy? will we be punished? yep. is it a natural instinct to find comfort with the opposite sex? yep. does it screwup the good order and discipline? yep. read robert heilein's starship troopers- or watch the crappy movie- you'll see that american society presently has a lot of gender hangups that make this a flawed effort.  we have some successes, but we have a long way to go.  presently they require seperate showers, berthing, and toilet facilities...which means some navy ships have to be expensively refurbished and welded to provide those spaces... also, it can be a distraction- it just is... as a soldier you train hard to mostly shut off that sexual need, and concentrate on the misery of your life while deployed- the scent of a woman is terribly distracting at those times and requires an even higher effort of selfdiscipline.  if you think the rules for sexual harassment are tough on cvillians-you have no idea what it is here.  also, consider the following tactical scenario... a flight crew gets shot down behind enemy lines and there are only 2 survivors- a male intelligence officer who has tactically important knowledge, and a female grunt who is a lower level iportance to the overall mission.  they hae been trapped in a POW camp for 8 months, and after being raped by her captor she is now pregnant. however, the rescue gets botched and there is only enough room to evacuate one of the prisoners-the intel officer is of tactical advantage, but he (in my opinion) must be left to save the innocent infant-further damaging the mission. i know its a stretch of the iagination, but i think it- and the public's horror and dismay at the jessica lynch episode, demonstrates that in our society's eyes a women captive is of more value than a man, and that gives me pause. and don't tell me about women aren't on the front lines- that's dated WW2 war theory- the front lines in a guerrilla war/ terrorism fight are constantly moving so that nowhere is safe...

how do i view internet surfing on a screen name my child has? history not on same computer though I'm not sure what you mean by "history not on same computer".\n\nThough it somewhat depends on the browser your child uses, there are a few ways of seeing what your child has been browsing.\n\nFirst is the history.  This is the easiest way.  I'm not sure if you meant that the history is stored elsewhere, or if your child erases the history...\n\nSecond is the address bar.  At the right end of the address text box, there is a small triangle which if you click on it will drop down a list of all the addresses that were typed in since the history was last erased.  Note that these are typed-in addresses only.  Websites visited via links won't show here.\n\nThird is the browser's cookies.  Cookies are small files used by most commercial websites to track visitors.  They're usually named based on the website name or address.  Viewing these differs by browser.

what,s the different between girls and boys,not biological?   Well, try EVERYTHING. We think differently, approach problems differently, have different priorities, deal with our emotions differently. Biology is a major factor in our differences - not just what we look like, but the levels of estrogen and testosterone and the way they affect our behavior. Some of our differences are caused by the influence of society.\n\nThe important thing is to realize that it's GOOD that we're different. We complement each other. Problems occur when we don't make the effort to understand and accept the other group. Just because "they" don't act like "we" do, doesn't make either side wrong.

Is it possible to get genital warts from other sources other than a parter during sex? I recently discovered some lumps er.. down below that I'm taking, from what they look like, to be warts, but I was wondering if its possible to get these from anywhere else... If I understand your question correctly, you are asking if you can get HPV in any way BESIDES having sex/sexual contact with another person.  The quick answer is no.  The HPV virus typically only lives in genital areas (altough there are rare cases where it is present in other mucosal tissue such as the mouth, but that's extremely rare).  The virus could theoretically survive for a small amount of time on an inanimate object (such as a toilet seat) but again, in order to get HPV this way would have to require some pretty controlled situations.  For example, someone with HPV would probably have to consciously rub their gential warts against the toilet seat, afterwhich you would need to contact that same area with your own genitalia almost immediately.  What are the chances of that?\n\nI also wanted to address mutual m*sterbation. You CAN get HPV from mutual mast. HPV warts can be microscopic, invisible to the naked eye. If you touch your partner's genitals and then touch your own with the same hand, you have most likely just put the HPV virus on your own skin. Whether or not you will develop warts/lesions is unpredictable. Some people have HPV but never show any lesions.

Just when you have all of lives answers WHY do they change all the questions?   tell me?   Because that is what life is about! Keeping us on our toes....keeping us alert......presenting challenge after challenge so that we never become stagnated and always strive to improve......to grow. If life were predictable, wouldn't we all be so bored. If we knew what was around each corner would we not turn around and go back? Sure.....we get to piss and moan about "Why didn't someone tell me this could happen???" But deep down inside, the pride from overcoming the obstacle outweighs the obstacle.Great question. :)

Even viruses designed for OSX (not that I know of any) have trouble executing just because of the robustness and security layers in the operating system itself, it might make it run slower but as far as wreaking havoc on a Mac, it's nearly impossible.  Spam has to do with email so there isn't much you can do there, that has nothing to do with the Operating system.  Also, there is little to no adware/spyware on the Mac, again because it is harder to execute on OSX and because the user base is so low for the Mac OSX platform.\n\nAnd your last part...if so, what?
I've liked this guy since last semester.  It seems like he likes me too.  What should I do?   talk to him. Maybe suggest a casual, group like date at first and go from there. Or if you are braver, try asking him to a more casual date, like maybe out for lunch, or coffee. Make it seem like you just want to chill and talk, nothing too overwhelming yet.

Why is there so much poverty in this world? Why do people go hungry when there's so much food that get's throw THERE'S SO MUCH FOOD THAT GET'S THROWN OUT EVERYDAY? WHY R PEOPLE GOING HUNGRY? One of the main reasons that there is so much poverty in the world is because of the evil dictators that rule some of these poverty stricken countries.  They take control of any revenue making buisness, as well as funds that other countries send to help out these countries, and keep it all for themselves.  They live in huge palaces living and eating it up,all the while their people are living in shacks and going hungry.\nMost of the people in America do not know true poverty, not to say all, but most, considering that even our poorest own TV's.  There is no reason for any child in this country to go hungry at night, with all the social programs, food banks and such that we have to help others out.

Are deer color-blind?   As far as I understand, deer are colorblind.  This is why hunter's\ncamoflage is red and black - it has the same values of dark and light as\nmilitary forest camoflage, so colorblind animals have a hard time seeing\nit.  Most people, at least those who are not red-green colorblind, can\neasily pick out the red color among the forest greens and browns.  So as\nlong as hunters only shoot at what they see, it reduces the chance of being\nin the line of fire.

How much is a  1973 newspaper clipping  'Frazier and Foreman fight' is worth? Can anyone tell me where to find out how much is a 1973 newspaper clipping 'Frazier and Foreman fight'is worth? One sure way to find out what something is worth is test the price that the market will bear, i.e. put it on Ebay.  Assuming Ebay is (more or less) a fair marketplace at the time at which you sell the item then the marketplace can give you an idea of what the item is worth. \n\nPricing an item this way also "automatically" takes into account the condition of the item and (because of the size and scope of Ebay) also takes into account the rarity of the item.  Where such a method fails is in the assumption: if the marketplace isn't fair (your item doesn't have the proper exposure or the people who are interested in your item aren't looking on Ebay) then you will of course fail to realize its true value.\n\nBut I still think Ebay will give you a good 1st-order approximation.\n\nWhile a newspaper

How come christians believe...? How come christians believe that god is some sort of big man up in the clouds when it says right in the bible 'god is love?' I personally am an athiest and I would like to know the answer to this. Christians believe because they are uninformed and encouraged NOT to explore or question their faith.  Jesus was believed to have said not to doubt him, or you will go to hell.  It seems as though Christianity does not sell well with the educated, but back then no one else could read and write but the few who passed on the teachings of the early Church from generation to generation.  Simplistically, most people who believe in God do so because of the many instabilities in their life and the necessity to latch on to something, even if mythical, that comforts them.  Too bad they can't find that trust within themselves, instead of a conflicting cartoon character in the sky.

They have no address, no reliable transportation, no real way to groom themselves or their clothing for interviews.  How many people would hire such a person?  Even if you were willing to do so, how would you contact them for an interview?  Think the dirty, rags-wearing, hobo bit is an act? they really drove to their corner in a Lexus and have a Razr cell phone in their pocket?  That is only the self-delusion nonsense of right-wing idealogues who say things like" they only do it cause they are lazy; wanna mooch off of us hard-working (read: White)citizens!"\nSure, a lot of homeless folks are there of their own accord- drugs, alcohol- bad choices- but a great percentage are mentally ill.  And if one decided to clean up, how could they?  Try it yourself...

how much weight should a woman lose per week?   There isn't really a good answer to this. It really depends if you are getting the proper nutrition and the proper protein. It also depends if you are really over weight or if you need to lose 10 pounds. A person that is over 100 pounds over weight could lose 5 pounds or more a week.  compared to a person needing to lose 10 pounds could lose 1 to 2 pounds a week.\n\nSerious inquries check out this link.

I recently developed an allergy to shrimp apparently. What else should I watch out for, if anything?   You should watch out for shellfish, i.e. lobster, crab, mussels, and other seafood like squid, calamari, eel.  Seafood allergies can be life-threatening and tend to get worse with repeated exposure. I carry an epi-pen and have to have another person serve my food at buffets that have seafood. I avoid shaking hands with people if at an event where seafood is served.  The food allgergy and anaphalaxis network website has excellent resource and information including cards that you can carry with you when you go to dinner to pass on to the chef about your allergy.

Have American drugs companies gotten out of hand? Are they controlling the way that medicine is practice?  Is every patient waiting for that super pill to make them healthy? American medicine before the invention of Penicillin was mainly nutrition.  Working at a hospital I see medicine pushed by drug reps.  Some of these medicines are based on the idea of the sugar pill.  If you believe it will work it will.  Here is a classic senario for you that happens all the time at the hospital.  A elderly patient comes in with a cold or a cough.  Instead of doing cultures and finding what is the best drug for them they give a broad spectrum antibiotic such as rocephin.  This knocks out their normal flora of bacteria in their intestines giving room for C. Diff. to become the predominate bacteria.  This causes diahreah and the patient comes back for dehydration and feeling really sick because of this bacteria.  Vancomyacin is then prescribed to knock out C. Diff.  It does to an extent but then your normal flora of E. Coli end up mutating to Vanc Resistant Ecoli.  This is not a neccessarily a bad thing since it is not a problem while it stays in the intestines.  But by this time the antibiotics have caused yeast infections such as thrush and what not and you are very sick.  The doctor ends up having the patient cathiterized and they develope an Urinary Tract infection with the VRE.  They then develope Sepsis and end up dying.  The catch 22 is that if they had not been prescribed the Rocephin this would not have happened, but the drug companies have come up with a "List" of drugs that should be given to any patient presenting to the hospital with any symptoms of pneumonia, such as a cough.  It is called "core measures".  If they don't prescribe these medicines they are looked down upon by the hospital AND drug companies even though these can ultimately end up killing the patient.

The magnetic pole is located hundreds of miles south of the geographic North Pole  at approximately 82.7° North and 114.4° West (2005), and the exact location varies from moment to moment.

why are capillaries from the circulatory system small and thin ? It is based on the circulatory system in your body. Capillaries are extremely small vessels located within the tissues of the body that transport blood from the arteries to the veins. Capillary walls are thin and are composed of endothelium (a single layer of overlapping flat cells). Oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrients and wastes are exchanged through the thin walls of the capillaries. Capillaries are so small that red blood cells can only travel through them in single file.

which team will be the best in the nfl in 2006? give reasons why. In the AFC it will come down to the Steelers or Colts. The Colts are fantastic, but the Steelers are as well. Aside from the loss to the Colts and the Patriots by three, the Steelers lost three games due to injuries. Those three games Jaguars, Ravens and Bengals all came down to the final minutes or overtime and all were by 6 points or less and in two of those games Maddox gave up six turnovers. Now they are all healthy and running on momentum. The Colts I'm sure will be ready, but I don't know if they will be flat or not for essentially not playing for a couple of weeks. With Jerome Bettis considering retirement and the superbowl in his hometown I think the Steelers have extra motivation. The defense is playing very well right now too. During the game with the Colts the Steelers lost 26-7, and they should have. But Big Ben's knees were still iffy and he broke his thumb halfway though the game. The Steelers did not run the ball 35 times, only 20 some. When they run the ball 35 times or more they are somehting on the order of 102-2. The Steelers had a chance to score 10 as they missed a field goal and the Colts scored 3 at the very end so there is the possibility that the game could have been 23-10. The Colts got a touchdown very early in the game in which the d-back did not stay with his responsibility. So say that mistake could have made the game 15-10. Aside from another touchdown the Colts scored three field goals. I think both teams are very even and it will be a very close game, something the Steelers have seen but the colts have not.

What are the structural differences between phospholipids and triglycerides? This is a Cell and Molecular biology class.  I need as much detail as possible please.  Thank you. Trigylcerides are composed of two types of molecules: glycerol and 3 fatty acids.\n\nPhospholipids are similar to triglycerides in that they contain glycerol and fatty acids, too. But, the big difference is that phospholipids are made up of 1 glycerol molecule and only 2 fatty acid molecules (not 3!)\n\nThis is a big difference because in place of the third fatty acid, phospholipids have a polar group attached to the glycerol molecule. Remember, triglycerides were entirely hydrophobic because all three positions on the glycerol molecule were taken up by nonpolar fatty acids. But, phospholipids have a polar group in one place on the glycerol molecule, making phospholipids partly hydrophilic; the polar group helps to form the polar head.  The two fatty acids, maintain a hydrophobic portion of the phospholipid, the tails.

Of course, one's diet depended to a great extent on social class. As those considered samurai could range in means from very poor to very rich-and thus experienced diets that crossed classes-we'll examine some generalities. \n\nRice \nUnsurprisingly, rice was a staple food, and was so important as to be considered a measure of wealth. Farming in Japan has never been an especially easy affair, and the life of a farmer could be a difficult one indeed. Much of Japan is mountainous, and yet even after the land was unified under the Tokugawa, each province needed to have some rice-growing potential. A few areas were idea and by the 16th Century had come to the realm's 'breadbaskets' - especially Ise Province and the Kanto Region. The Kanto in particular was well suited to agricultural development, with wide, flat stretches of land for fields and rivers to provide irrigation. Other, more mountainous provinces, like nearby Kai, presented their lords and farmers with many problems, and required a great deal more effort to optimize production. Rice fields were cut into the sides of hills, and rivers arduously dammed and diverted. Yet the work was vital - fa

baseball stitches?   Baseball stitches that hold the two identical halves of a baseball's horsehide skin together permit the pitcher a better grip and also contributes to curve balls.  As the curve ball spins, the velocity of the skin relative to the air surrounding the ball on its path is different on opposite sides of the ball, creating a slight vacuum altering the course of the ball.  You can shape your hands and fingers to simulate the special curvature of a baseball skin and seems.\n\nThe baseball skin was invented in my home town of Stoughton, Mass. where I believe they were going to erect a suitable monument at one time.  At the baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, I saw only a small faded news article, within a glass case filled with the oldest baseballs, that even mentioned the invention.  I'm glad you asked.

Do you think God exists?? or are we just assuming there is God somewhere in the universe watching us??!!? Please give ur opinions with relevant reasons to support urselves.. "ur experiences with God" are also welcome.. Thanks!!  =) Of course there is some question of, "Why are we here?" and the "Meaning of life?" I believe strongly in God. I believe he sent his son down to earth to die for my sins, your sins, and everyone sins. Jesus, bridges the gap between God and us that was separated when Adam and Eve first turn their backs on him in the Garden of Eden. Sacrificing something pure, like a lamb, then was the gap filled. But then Jesus came, a pure being, God’s only son, he was like the lamb, pure and without sin, sacrificed for our sins to fill the gap between God and us. Believing in Jesus and accepting him into our lives fill that gap to God and we have access to eternal life. \n\nGod is so significant in my life. My mother was taken from me at 12 years old by ovarian cancer. I didn’t think God cared. Later I experienced trials of my faith. I grew to learn that there is a purpose to everything and that everything happens for a reason. Everything happens for the best. \n\nOne certain case, I believe, would be that an angel of the Lord confronted me. I had had some troubles at home and I stormed off to my school. I sat there on the swing sets looking down at the ground. I noticed the school was completely empty. I cannot recall any sound of the highway that could be heard very clearly near by. Then I noticed a young woman with blonde hair. She was pushing a baby in a stroller. She had been walking around the track and soon came to the playground, which I had been the whole time. She slowly approached and asked if I was all right. Of course, I said yes, trying to shrug her off. She asked me if I knew about Jesus. I thought that she saw it was a perfect opportunity to preach about Jesus and God. I already knew all that stuff, I told her I knew him and told her my father is involved with the church. She smiled and said that that was nice. She then said something I will never forget. She said with a smile on her face, “Alright, just know that He loves you and knows that you are upset.” I smiled, thinking that she was being nice. She started walking away and she said, “Nice talking to you, Michael.” She walked away towards the surrounding school buildings. I then realized, I never mentioned my name. I didn’t even know her. In a small community, I had never seen her before. I then got on my bike and rode to the building to talk again with her. She had gone past the building very shortly before I arrived there on my bike. I turned the corner and she wasn’t there. It was physically impossible to get out of the school that fast, especially with a baby. I was then filled with a great sense of power and strength. It was a great feeling. I rode my bike home faster than ever. I was crying all the way home.\n\nI have told this story to only a few people. I never expected people to believe me; I could care less if they didn’t. I believe what happened. I was there. That helped incidence helped me so much. I felt much better after that. Today, I still have problems. I am human. But I can always turn to Jesus for help. I believe in him by Faith, and Faith alone. That is all you need to attain salvation! Faith.\n\nI hope you understand to that God loves you. \n             God Bless You!\n                  Michael DeCourcy
seismograph?   The simplest explanation:\n\nA seismograph is just basically a pen on a spring (although now days this is replaced by a sensor) It measures ground motion. Earthquakes, nuclear weapons tests, the impact of waves striking the coast, the rumble of trucks on a highway, volcanoes and many other things can result in ground motion that a seismograph can measure. Seismologists looking for oil can use vibrating trucks or underground explosions to send waves into the ground that seismographs can measure, and turn into pictures of what the earth looks like underground.  \n\nOf course, this can get far more complicated. Some seismographs can measure lower frequencies, even using superconductivity, etc. Seismographs really measure ground acceleration, which is the second derivative of ground displacement.
Is there any professional hockey in Orlando or nearby area?  excluding Tampa & Sunrise.?   The Florida Seals are a minor-league ice hockey team, currently a member of the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL). Originally based in Orlando, Florida, they are now based in Kissimmee, Florida, a suburb south of Orlando in Osceola County. The ownership group of the Seals is led by David Waronker.\n\nThe team was formed as the Orlando Seals, and played its first season beginning in October 2002 with the Atlantic Coast Hockey League (ACHL). It was the winner of that league's first and only President's Cup in 2003. When the ACHL folded, they and two other teams, the Jacksonville Barracudas and the Macon Trax, merged into the new World Hockey Association 2 (WHA2), founded by Waronker himself. After the 2003-2004 season, the World Hockey Association served a cease-and-desist order on the WHA2 and it merged with the South East Hockey League (SEHL) to form the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL).\n\nThe Orlando Seals were scheduled to play in the 2004-2005 SPHL season, but on August 22, 2004, the City of Orlando revoked its lease at the TD Waterhouse Centre, causing them to miss the season. On October 19, 2004, the ownership group announced a new three-year lease with the Silver Spurs Arena in Kissimmee. The team resumed play in the 2005-2006 season, hosting their first home game against the Jacksonville Barracudas on October 29, 2005.\n\nThe mascot of the Florida Seals is Sealvester. He wears a jersey emblazoned with the number "02".

Why is that my serious and"intelligent" questions don't get answered but...? my "non-serious" or fun questions get overwhelming respones?\n\n\nhmm...

But those silly questions are easy because they have those problems everyday and just know out of expirience the right answer for a funny laugh.
who invented the internet?   No one person invented the Internet as we know it today. However, certain major figures contributed major breakthroughs:\n\n(1) Leonard Kleinrock was the first to publish a paper about the idea of packet switching, which is essential to the Internet. He did so in 1961. \n\n(2) J.C.R. Licklider was the first to describe an Internet-like worldwide network of computers, in 1962. He called it the "Galactic Network."\n\n(3) Larry G. Roberts created the first functioning long-distance computer networks in 1965 and designed the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the seed from which the modern Internet grew, in 1966.\n\n(4) Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf invented the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) which moves data on the modern Internet, in 1972 and 1973.\n\n(5) By 1983, TCP was the standard and ARPANET began to resemble the modern Internet in many respects. The ARPANET itself was taken out of commission in 1990. Most restrictions on commercial Internet traffic ended in 1991, with the last limitations removed in 1995. NCSA Mosaic web browser also came out in 1993, the first browser that supported both text and graphics.\n\nFor an excellent article on history and evolution of the Internet, refer to the following links:\nhttp://www.isoc.org/internet/history/\nhttp://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml\n\nOn the lighter side, as popularly said, 'Al Gore' invented the internet. That's not the truth. Refer to http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=AjD6K1uz8OfCRUVj37IHU_YjzKIX?qid=1005121801557  to get an insight on this issue.
how can i go about turning my nextel phone that is under contract to a pre paid?   Unfortunately, you have to buy a boost phone, and swap the SIM cards, in order to use the your old phone itself. Keep in mind that you still have to cancel your service w/ Nextel, and that the SIM card itself is what has all of your numbers stored on it for your phonebook. You need the boost sim card in your phone to make it prepaid.\nP.s. Nextel can track the phone if you turn it back on after reporting it stolen. 400 dollar fee if you get caught!!

this message appears when i have installed win98 in my pc? "THIS PROGRAM HAS PERFORMED AN ILLEGAL OPERATION AND WILL BE SHUT DOWN, CONTACT THE PROGRAM VENDOR"\n\nwhat does this message mean and ask me to do with my pc. any solution please? Some type of installed software is failing.  It could be anything that you've installed, including the operating system.\n\nAre you saying you just recently installed win98 or it's always been there?  Whatever software change you made recently is likely the culprit.  It could be anything such as installing a game.  It could also be a corrupt DLL.  If you can figure out what program is causing it, you should reinstall that application to try to fix it.\n\nTry to narrow down the software that's causing the bug.  Start up in safe mode first, to make sure it isn't the operating system.  When you reboot the computer, press F8 continuously until the boot options menu comes up, then choose "Safe mode" or "safe mode with networking".  If it starts fine after that, then it's likely something other than Windows that's failing.
Why does the American Flag have 50 Stars if it was made before United States annexed Hawaii and Alaska?   The flag did not have 50 stars until after Alaska and Hawaii were admitted to the union. Before then, there were 48 stars, and briefly 49 stars.\n\nThe number of stars has increased with the number of states in the union... and early on, there were also additional stripes.

If I throw a radio into a tub of water, how long before it is safe to pull the radio out?   If it is a battery powered radio you should be able to pull it out without getting shocked (unless it's using some pretty powerful batteries).  If it plugs in to the wall unplug it, wait a couple of minutes to be safe, and pull it out.  But I think the real question is: why would you throw a radio into a tub of water?!

What do I do when my favorite brother won't have any contact with me for four years? My only sister fell off a golf cart and went into a coma.  Things were not going well so we had a family meeting and the pastor from my parents and my church came to give his support and pray.   My fav.brother  didn't approve of all the praying that we were doing.  My sister got better and now is a functioning adult with some difficulties.  He returned the Christmas presents from 4 years ago on my parents front porch.   He has not talked with us since my sister got better.  He has changed his answering machine so it is not his voice on it anymore.  He was always there for me when my other family members weren't.  I miss him so much.  I have gone to his house with my niece and no one would come to the door but we could hear someone moving around inside.  I have called, written, and visited but no response.  I love him and I want him to meet my husband and my stepson. Send him a letter explaining how much you miss him.  Ask his forgiveness for any hurts he may have received, whether intended or not, or even known about.  The thing to remember is that people are very strange when they are stressed with family emergencies.  Also, he may be feeling guilty, or may be afraid of hearing "I told you so."  Under no circumstances should you bring up the past; let him discuss what he wants.  Additionally, if you do decide to meet with him, go alone.
How do China and India survive in their economy despite of over population?   India is too diverse to explain in a line. I'd say, population is not a problem now, its getting better now. The birth rates are declining, and by 2040, the population will stop expanding.\n\nEvery year, 40 million new people join the middle class leaving poverty. As the population is huge, its a huge market, and everyone gets to sell his product/services. And with the flow of foreign investment, its been a huge amount of new jobs being created. And the outsourcing is helping new software professionals trained in India. New agricultural equipment, with farmers getting richer and richer, are getting common, and agriculture is also doing well.\n\nIts not so sweet though, there is corruption, poverty, illiteracy, riots. But we all are determined to make a better India.
whcih is the best doctor? eg; neurologyst/ endocrinologyst, . etc.etc?

You see?

would anyone hire a nurse with a felony background? But had good reason?   It would really depend on the nature of the crime.  \n\nIf it was a felony dwi over ten years ago, and the nurse has been sober and a twelve stepper since, the answer would be yes.\n\nIf it were a case of felony manslaughter, where the conviction was classified as a felony because of martial arts training, and/or where either self-defense or defense of an innocent was a factor, the answer would be yes.\n\nOff the top of my head, I really can't think of any other crime that wouldn't always leave me wondering about the nurse's use of judgement or intention.

can a DNA test be wrong?   i hope so.? i know they say it's an accurate test, but think about this...  if you tested every single man in this world to be your dad, EXCEPT your dad (that you know is yours), i bet one of them would match as your father, even though they aren't. it seems like it would be possible to share dna, because this world is a big place. just curious. anyone agree with me?  thanks for answers. actually, if the lab who does the testing is processing a lot of samples it is likely that once in a while samples may get mixed up by mistake.

Another corrupted file!? I got another corrupted file on my other PC. It says that C:&#92;WINDOWS&#92;Fonts&#92;BRWSB.TTF is corrupted. Usualy corrupted files show up anyway, but this one doesn't. I tried looking for it on the PC I'm using now, but it's not there. I was thinking that it might be a hiiden registry component, if that's possible. It's hard to believe that the corruption of a single font can cause my PC to run so unstablely. Anyone got any ideas? If you have it on your computer, E-mail it to me at aldo1022000@yahoo.com\nThanks alot. You probably have a virus. A file is a file, a registry component is an entirely different thing altogether.\n\nOpen up My computer.\nGo to Tools Menu > Folder Options\nClick the view tab\nSelect "Show hidden files and folders"\nDeselect "hide protected operating system files"\nClick OK\n\nNow to go C:&#92;windows&#92;fonts and find that file and delete it if you want, but you probably don't have a font called "B..." so what you really need to do is get an antivirus program and scan your system.

Help? how can i make friend? or meet (hopefully) a best friend, or should i be happy with my boyfriend??? Help???????????? I would tell you that you should get involved in some school activities to meet people.  You think it's hard now, wait until later!  It gets even harder when you're out of school.  I can tell you from personal experience because I was with a guy of 8 years, we moved all around the country, and I lost touch with everyone I knew.  Now I'm back here in my home town and I'm lucky to have been able to hunt down 2 of my old friends.  I'm not with the guy I was with for 8 years anymore and I have no idea how and when I'll meet my next boyfriend because I don't know very many people.  \n\nMoral of the story.. make friends now, make GOOD friends, who are gonna be around for a long time. You have no idea how things will end up with your guy, if things don't work out and you have no friends to get you out of the house you'll be so miserable.  Just remember, it only gets harder as you get older to meet new people.  Do it now.  You'll be a better girlfriend for it, too, because you won't be relying on your guy to entertain you or go do such and such with you all the time.  That was an issue between my ex and I as the years passed, it was really hard on him.  It was hard on me, too.  I went shopping with my friends the other day and I realized how awesome it was to have someone to help me pick out clothes to buy and to run back and forth and grab different sizes for me so I didnt' have to keep going in and out of the dressing room.  Little things.  There are subjects that you just can't talk about w/ your guy, they dont' understand.  It's all about the little things and you will really appreciate having a friend around.  You can never have too many!

what evidence did james watson and francis crick use to deduce the structure of DNA.?   GraemeW mentioned Rosaline Franklin and he is exactly right to do so!  Without her work with X ray defraction, which Francis and Crick stole from her, they probably wouldn't have been the discoverers of the DNA double helix structure.  Linus Pauling probably would have beaten them to it.\nFranklin took a "picture" of the structure of DNA that showed its structure to be a double helix.  They knew the chemical compostion from tests that had been run, and they figured up the pairing of the bases by using cardboard cut outs.
My monitor never turns off, even though it is set to turn off after 1 minute.  How do I fix this? Screen saver is the same.  It is set for 1 minute, but it never turns on.  My monitor is left on, and with no screen saver, all of the time.  It's bad for the monitor, and bad b/c it uses more energy.  Any ideas? Sound like it's going into "stand by " mode in which case that is not bad; it actually takes more energy to power up from "off" and that repeated action is bad for your monitor to perform over and over...

Myths of Dictatorships? 1)  Dictatorships oppress everybody!\n-Dictatorships still need public support just like under democratic regimes to get power.\n2) Dictatorships are inefficient.\n-Dictatorships are the most efficient goverment since the 'dictator' passes policies faster than you can read this post, rather under democratic regimes where you have to go through layers of branches which will take forever.\n\nWhat other myths would you like to add? Dictatorships come to save the people from a greater danger. Wrong! They come for dictators (and their business partners) to do their business. And when there's nothing else left to take away, they leave.\n\nDictatorships (at least in Latin America) were only about ideology. Wrong! Dictators (and their accomplices) stole money and properties from the people they captured, killed and took their children away from.\n\nDictatorships are a necessary evil. Wrong! In democracy, a bad government is taken away when its term ends, by voting for a better government. There's no need to call dictators in.\n\nDictatorships have high moral standards, and act according to them. Wrong! What's moral about overthrowing a democratic government, in the first place. And what is moral about killing, robbing, making people disappear, and all of that in the name of a supposed ideology?\n\nDictators are justified in that they know better than the misinformed unprepared people about how to rule a country. Wrong! Even if people are misinformed and unprepared, that is no justification for going against their decisions. Inform and prepare the people better, instead!

why does my laptop keep shutting down while i'm working offline or online? a pop up box will appear saying i need to save my work and will be shutting down in seconds. This happens alot. any suggestions. gateway laptop. windows home xp software. I've had this problem with my laptop as well. I tried looking for every problem I could think of--viruses, malfunctioning updates, spyware, or overheating. I'd suggest looking for all of these culprits first. In my case, none of these problems were responsible for my computers flaky performance, so I decided to format my hard drive and install a fresh copy of XP--now my computer works like a charm:)

Why does the metheorologis (weather man) hides the mexican penisula of Baja California on the TV screen? Do this has to do with a boicoit againts Mexico turis pleces from the US Gov. So they persude the people not to go there, not showing the nice weather conditions? .Instead they want pleople to go to the peninsula of Flodida, something like the boicoit agains Cuba Island, Istead they preffer to show a big part of Canada's map. I think that's a bit of a schwinging comment to make. During the hurricane season in 2005 when Cancun was hit, the weather forecasters on Fox News made a deliberate attempt to show the forecast for Cancun. It could be argued here in the UK that the weather forecasters turn their back on the Republic of Ireland in protest over the 1921 partition. No they don't, they've got to stand somewhere and wherever they stand, they are going to block part of the UK

Altitude of noon sun during the four different seasons of the year? in Equator?\nTropic of Cancer?\nTropic of Capricorn?\nDana Point? The position of the noon Sun varies throughout the year.  During the summer months it can be located as much as 23.5 degrees above (or north of ) the celestial equator and in winter the same angle below (or south of) the celestial equator.  \n\nFirst you have to know the latitude of each of these places to find out the position of the celestial equator in the sky.  \n\nLatitudes\nEquator = 0 degrees\nTropic of Cancer = 23.5 N\nTropic of Capricorn = 23.5 S \nDana Point, CA = about 34 N\n\nSo the altitudes of the celestial equator at these positions is 90 minus latitude.\n\nAltitude of celestial equators\nEquator = 90 degrees\nTropic of Cancer = 66.5 from south horizon\nTropic of Capricorn = 66.5 from north horizon \nDana Point, CA = about 56 degrees from south horizon\n\nOn the vernal and autumnal equinoxes the position of the noon Sun is on the celestial equator.  So just look at the above list to read off the altitude.\n\nOn the summer (winter) solstice the position of the noon Sun is 23.5 north (south) of the celstial equator.  So just add or subtract 23.5 degrees from the list above of altitudes.  For example Dana point:\n\nAltitude of noon Sun on the first day of \nSpring = 56 degress from south horizon\nSummer = 79.5 (56+23.5) degress from south horizon\nAutumn = 56 degress from south horizon\nWinter = 32.5 (56-23.5) degress from south horizon\n\nHope that was clear

Explain what serendipity means to you.?   For me, serendipity is something that comes into my life just when I seem to need it.\n\nIt could be a person, a piece of information, a "sign" that tells me I'm making the right decision.  For instance, when we bought a previous home, we knew we would get it because my wife was pregnant and the cross street was "Concepcion" (conception).  Another time, the house we made an offer on was on Solana and, when we had dinner at Chili's that night, they had "Solano Steak" on the menu.  We got the house.\n\nDo I really believe in "signs" from some divinity? No. I just believe that these events are constantly happening but we only register them when we are ready to receive them.  That doesn't dimish the effect of serendipity because it makes life fun and interesting.

However I don't feel it is an asteriod for the same reason.  I think that the best description is a Kuiper Belt object.  These are objects located on the outer edge of the solar system that resemble large comets but never get close to the Sun.  Pluto has much in common with these objects but just happens to be one the the largest and closest.

My father found out I have been intimate with my step-mother, how can I smooth this situation over? My father met my step-mother about two years, there is about a 15 years age difference between us, I am 30, she is 45.  It's a sticky situation. I'm guessing you didn't have too close a relationship with your father to be able to see his wife sexually let alone have sex with her. Stay away from her and keep letting your Dad know how sorry you are, I don't think this is something that will smooth over quickly but you may regain part of your relationship with your father with some time, depending on how close the two of you are. Stay away from that woman no matter what happens! Good Luck

What is the difference between a laser mouse and an optical mouse?   "The difference between a regular optical mouse and a laser mouse is the light used to track movement. A regular optical mouse uses an LED light in the optical engine, while a laser mouse uses a laser to track movement.

why do women put on headscarfs when not moslems,what shape and style should they be put on,when and where ?   I have had and worn scaves amost of my life. Scarves were fashion until recently. This is what i found on a website noted in the sources section below.\n\n"a lost art...wearing headscarves...what today is sometimes called head wraps. Back in the 1950's, 60's, and early 70's, wearing headscarves was fashionable...even with teenage girls. So what happened? \n\nThree turns of fate...\n\nFirst, the Catholic Church stopped requiring that women cover their heads in church. Second, the carmakers stopped making convertibles (they make them again, but the damage is done). Finally (and worst of all), the Iranian takeover of the US Embassy (in Iran) in 1979. Headscarves were linked with religion again, but this time (in what Western countries perceived) in a negative way. Of course, there were changes in hairstyles and other factors, but these were the big three...particularly the last.  Of course, the September 11th attack and the war with Iraq has once again provided an unfair negative focus on headscarves."\n\nIn the Western world (except for the Catholic Church) the scarf was a fashion accessory, not religious clothing.

how to down load video clips from a web site and hide it from others to see.?   So you are downloading porn and you dont what people to see that you have porn on your pc. Now that is funny.

But make sure you make a lot of folders to get there in case they are looking and it takes them a long time to get there.

I take my date to a drive-in-movie, she wears a short skirt, should I try to move my hand under her skirt?   Only if you want to.\n\nJust kidding, of course.  My opinion?\n\nBefore you start making out with her...  No.\n\nAfter you start making out with her and you're at least ten minutes into it...  Yes!  You bet!  If she doesn't want you there, she'll let you know one way or the other.\n\nBy the way, when I was growing up, getting under a girl's skirt was considered third base.  And I think we all know that you don't go directly from the batter's box directly to third base.  It's against the rules!  You start from the top and work your way down...  slowly,  ever so slowly.\n\nTo Gyrl6:  You're cute!

what's the difference between a "world champion" and an "international champion" in boxing?   the only real difference is the boxing sanctions.  theres the WBF(world boxing association) WBC(World Boxing Council) IBF (International Boxing federation) IBO (International Boxing Organization) and a few more.  They're just different sanctions for the purpose of making more money.  But of course there could be a boxer who wins the nationaal championship in his country, and then travels to another country and challenges they're national champion and wins.  he'd be holding national championships from two different countries.  which would by definition make him an international champion.  Hope i was of some help to you.

Calling all computer geeks!? I just installed another 512mb of RAM into my machine.  It is the exact same make and model as my other 512mb stick (SAMSUNG 512MB PC2700 333MHz DDR).  Now when I throw a heavy RAM task at it (Microsoft Flight SIM 04), it crashes-even with the original defaults reset.  I have run a RAM stress test and it comes back 100% OK.  What am I doing wrong??\n\nAMD Athlon XP 3000+   2.17ghz  1024mb RAM (64mb used for display) did your flight sim ever run on this machine? before you added the 2nd set of RAMM?\n\nWith the PC utilizing 64Mb for the video memory have you thought that it could be a video issue?  I know that in my machines I will never use the on-board video processor to handle anything, let alone games.\n\nHave you checked to see if all your BIOS is updated and all drives and firmware is good?  Kinda a shot in the dark with this but thats where I might start.\n\nAlso, check to see if there is a patch for the game running on certain chip sets/OS/hardware configurations.

does cranberry juice and vinegar clean your piss? yea i gotta take a piss test probly in da next week and was wonderin how i can help clean it up and i heard so many things to make it clean but dont no which one is true.so if any one no the real answer could u jus let me know. *Shaking my furry skull* Noperz, the only guaranteed way to get a negative test is to not do the drugs. Especially pot as it will stay in your system for up to 30 days.\n\nNow mind you, there are things one can do to get false negatives, drinking lots of liquids, certain compounds sold on the market ect.\n\nProblem is, if the urine is too clear like drinking liquids will do, that is grounds for rejection and they will want another sample. With additives they test for that as soon as they become aware of the additive and then you fail for that.\nOften you are not left alone when the sample is given so cannot substitute for clean urine, dilute, or put in a negative creating chemical.\n\nWhich leaves one with the choice of before even giving the sample taking and informing the lab at collection time things like advil (for thc) which will result in a false positive even if you are clean. But at best you only delay your test.\n\nWhich gets us right back to must stay clean for the period of time it takes for the drugs to leave your system.\n\nMind you, you can do a search online for more info, but no one is gonna say "Oh gee they now test for our product." So buyer beware.

Why do Moslems have their pyajamas and trousers just bove their ankles? Have noticed it everywhere. The pajamas and the lengths of the pants are just "above" the heels. Anybody has ideas, why? The wahhabis (sect of Islam) wear their trousers above their ankles. I am not sure why but I  think they believe thats how the prophet used to wear it.\n  Most muslims prefer to wear their trousers in a normal way with the end of the trouser NOT touching the earth but just above 1 cm from the floor.\n  Reason1: The floor is full of garbage and dirt and they dont want to dirty their clothes. Some things are considered unpure and thus they dont wan t it to touch their clothes like urine.\n\n  reason 2: Respect. There is more respect to a person dressed appropriately  and not like a hooligan dragging his pants everywhere and sweeping the floor with his trousers. \n \n  Reason 3: Because they were their trouser at the wasit line and not below the buttocks.\n\n  Reason 4: Its believed that Gays during the time of Prophet Lut (Lot) used to wear their clothes dragging it on the floor (like the trousers). So muslims dont want to do it that way.\n\n  Reason 5: Take the reason of gateway above mine. \n         Thank yoou Gateway.

PSII absorbs light energy and raises an electron to a higher energy level. This energy is used to do what?   "Energetic Electrons (from:refernce listed below)\n \nPhotosystem II is the first link in the chain of photosynthesis. It captures photons and uses the energy to extract electrons from water molecules. These electrons are used in several ways. First, when the electrons are removed, the water molecule is broken into oxygen gas, which bubbles away, and hydrogen ions, which are used to power ATP synthesis. This is the source of all of the oxygen that we breathe. Second, the electrons are passed down a chain of electron-carrying proteins, getting an additional boost along the way from photosystem I. As these electrons flow down the chain, they are used to pump hydrogen ions across the membrane, providing even more power for ATP synthesis. Finally, the electrons are placed on a carrier molecule, NADPH, which delivers them to enzymes that build sugar from water and carbon dioxide." \n\nIn a nutshell, these energized electrons provide the energy for anything in the cell that needs energy.

Please Help? Scenario: So today i saw a beatuiful girl in a clothing store. Houw should i go about talking to her, and maby getting a date out of it?\n\nlike what would be a good 1st conversaton topic? First and foremost, be yourself. You wanna first talk about what is in the surrounding enviroment, clothing etc.  Be a customer, ask questions, not too many, and don't go to far into personal detail about yourself.  You don't wanna tell a girl everything right off the bat, cause then there wouldn't be that getting to know you stage.  Keep her curious, and make her laugh. Be confident, smile and get her curious.  Compliment her but don't go overboard.  Don't use words like hot, sexy, your fine.  Use words lik beautiful, nice, proper words not slangs.  Keep eye contact.  Don't look at her breast or behind, no matter how tempting it may be, don't do it.  Don't bug her, don't harras her, just go with the flow.  If its not there, learn from it and move on.  If it is there, than you'll see it in her smile and her eyes, if you pay attention to those two things than you can learn alot from a womans heart.  Remember the expression, Your words say one thing but your eyes say another. The eyes are always right

Here is your detailed synopsis:\n\nKyle Pratt is a frantic but fiercely intelligent mother whose deepest protective instincts will be triggered by a haunting in-flight nightmare: in the middle of the trans-Atlantic trip, her young daughter turns up missing without a trace. Or does she? Kyle arrives on the flight still reeling from the recent loss of her husband, a woman who has gone mad with grief or a formidably determined mother whose child is in grave danger that threatens the entire plane? Adding to the growing mystery is the fact that the name of Kyle's daughter doesn't even appear on the flight manifest. Furthermore, neither of the flight attendants can remember seeing the child on the plane? Adding to the growing mystery is the fact that the name of Kyle's daughter doesn't even appear on the flight manifest. Furthermore, neither of the flight attendants can remember seeing the child on the plane. While Captain Rich and Air Marshal Gene Carson don't want to doubt Kyle's insistent claim that her daughter has vanished, all evidence points to the fact that Kyle's little girl was never on board. What is the truth behind Kyle Pratt's distress? Who on board can be trusted? And just how far will Kyle have to go to get to the bottom of the harrowing mystery? As paranoia and doubt mount among the passengers, Kyle is confronted with some of the most unsettling fears a mother could ever face--losing her child, having her very reality questioned and being trapped in a situation where no one can seem to help. Pushed to the edge and fighting for her sanity, Kyle finds herself willing to go to unimaginable lengths to save her daughter.\n\nStarring:   Jodie Foster, Peter Sarsgaard, Sean Bean, Kate Beahan, Michael Irby

why sublingual drug absorption is faster?   Sublingual absorbtion:  the absorbtion of a substance through a mucous membrane...\n\nIs not faster than smoking, but significantly faster than oral consumption... reason being that oral consumption requires the substance to pass through the gastro intestinal system first (you have to digest it) whereas sublingual absorbtion goes directly to the bloodstream...  sublingual absorbtion can also be expodited (speed up) by introducing food grade ethanol (alcohol), however, mixing drugs is a foolish and potentialy dagerous endeavor...  Please use caution.

Provide the name of the only person in American history convicted of treason who was later pardoned? I have already found the name of the person - Iva Toguri, nicknamed Tokyo Rose. However, I need a hard copy that states that she was the only, ONLY, person in American history to be accused and then pardoned. Thanks Here's a couple of links that should provide the details you need.  I've included the paragraphs that state that Tokyo Rose was the only person ever pardoned after a treason conviction.\n\n\nhttp://www.discoverthenetwork.org/Articles/Innocent%20of%20Treason.htm\n\n"In 1977 Iva Toguri d'Aquino was pardoned fully and unconditionally by President Gerald Ford, who, in his last official act, restored her citizenship. She was the only American ever pardoned after being convicted of treason. "\n\n\nhttp://forejustice.org/wc/tr/tokyo_rose_040503.htm\n\n"In November 1976 Wayne Merrill Collins, the son of Iva’s trial lawyer filed a presidential pardon petition for Iva. The public disclosures supporting her innocence were so convincing by that time, that on January 19, 1977, in one of his last acts prior to leaving office, President Ford pardoned Iva Toguri d’Aquino. She is the only person convicted of treason in this country that has been pardoned."

Is it essential that we have a media voice questioning the integrity of  government behavior?   I guess it depends what kind of government you want and what kind of country you want to live in.\n\nFor the kind of place I prefer to live, a media voice questioning the integrity of government behavior is absolutely essential as is it's right to do so. Inflamitory media is an American institution and without such voices, this country, as we know it, would not exist. We'd probably still be part of the British Empire.

I DON'T HAvE MONEY TO PAY FOR my wifes BIRTH CAN I APPLY FOR AN EMERGANCY MEDICAIDE If you're going to a hospital that receives federal funding, they are legally obligated to provide emergency services whether or not you can pay.  The social worker at the hospital should be able to tell you what payment plans are available to you.  The important thing is to get your wife to a hospital right away when the contractions start. Pack a suitcase with a few days' worth of clothing for her and basic hygiene supplies.  Keep it by the door, ready to go.  If you really can't afford a hospital, you might be able to find a licensed midwife who will deliver the baby at home.

what is electric charge?I doesnt mean its results.?   An electrical charge is an imbalance between an atom's positive and negative units (Protrons and electrons).  A discharge of electrical energy happens when electrons jump from one atom to on that is differently charged to bring the two atoms closer to a balance.  If an atom has more electrons that protons, it is negatively charged.  If it has more protons than electrons, then it is positively charged.

Why do birds sometimes take craps in mid-flight?   Waste not.  Some times they just cannot hold it any longer.\nMid-flight is better that in their nest.  Even a bird brain could figure that out.  They usually have trouble reaching the handle on the in-flight toilet of the airplane, however, so often the next passenger to use the facilities needs to flush for them.
what prohibits human men from evolving?   :}\nPeople change over time based on nutrition even environment. The theory of evolution depends on a concept called “survival of the fittest”. That theory works as far as our gene pool will allow it to. There are millions of possible combinations within our gene pool; at any given time those genes which best allow individuals to survive and prosper will emerge.\nBut that is change within our genetic structure not evolution.\nThe reason men do not evolve is that we cannot create new DNA or new and different genes and they do not occur by chance.

how do you know if a guy likes you??? Sometimes he acts like he likes me and other times he completely ignores me.  I'm confused!!  Help!! Guys and Girls are equally just as strange in their tactics for courting.\n\nThere are some different possibilities for your situation. I definitely need more specific information about how this guy is acting. But I’ll give it a shot.\n\nGuys are afraid that if they act like they like a girl too much that they will be turned off and ditch the guy.\n\nGuys are also afraid that if they put them selves out there to much they don’t want to get used by the girl.\n\nSome guys Ignore girls for an ego boost. Acting like they don’t give a poo about it. Mainly because it makes your more of a player if you act like you don’t need girls cause you already have so many.\n\nI doubt that this guy might be ignoring you because he is afraid of rejection by you. Some guys just ignore girls they like so they don’t have to deal with rejection. I’m guilty of that.\n\nOr he could just be a dick and not give a poo about you. And he could be just using you for whatever it is he might get.\n\nAnother option is he might just be really busy, caught up in his life. I go to school and work and girls don’t get to see me all the time they tend not to like the fact that I don’t have a whole lot of spare time to see them.\n\nWell I think that kinda covers some ground on the subject. I hope that helps. Good luck.

I lost my girlfriend that i love dearly because of my lying what do i do to get her back? I love my ex very much and i would do anything to get her back but i dont know what to do. She is in washington stae now and i am in illinois i am lost without her and i feel helpless what do i do? i am sorry to say, but once you break a girl's heart you leave room for another to come mend it. now i am not saying that she's off with another guy, but i think you pretty much ruined your chances of getting back with her, long distance relationship or not, when a girls hurt, especially by lying it's hard for them to believe anything that a guy says to them afterwards. if you really loved her, you would have treated her better while you were still together, wouldnt' you agree? just move on and try to do better in your next relationship. good luck to you.
Where can I find resources on church love offerings?   By "resources" I assume you mean biblical references. Here are two.\nActs 4:32-37 describes believers sharing their possessions.\nJohn 12:1-3 Jesus is anointed with a gift of perfume.\n\nHowever if you are interested in what is done with love offerings that should be explained by the one who is collecting for them.
What does it mean if your sweat is brown? I have never before had an issue with my clothes staining or anything like that, but I have noticed in the past few days my underarms are leaving BROWN on my bras, deoderant stick, shirts, etc.  This is pretty embarrassing for me, as you can imagine.  Does anyone know what could cause this? I'm not saying your probably dirty but try using a loafa with your soap or body wash in the shower.  Shower in the mornings before you start your day to know you are clean and apply deoderant on freshly cleaned skin.  I know that your sweat can smell stronger when you've eaten spicey foods and a lot of greasy foods, so maybe the tent is from the foods too.  Or maybe you aren't drinking enough water either.  When you urinate, is your urine dark or clear?  Dark soda could be the cause.  Try more water and cut out soda and eat fruits and veggies too.
Is it normal for a younger sister to be overly protective of her older brother and who he dates? A younger sister who was once very friendly towards me got very stand-offish with me once she realized i was dating her brother. Is this normal? And why would she act this way if she did like me to start with? I think it is fairly normal. I am a younger sister to three brothers and I think it can just make you nervous because you don't want your brother to get hurt and their is girls stepping into your territory. At first I  did'nt like any of my brothers girlfriends but after a while I was OK. Just give her time she'll eventually come around.

Is it good to be a vegetarian ?? I am thinking to be a vegetarian. Is it good to be a vegetarian ? And which one is better, start to reduce eating meat, or just stop eating meat,  as soon as i decide to be a vegetarian ? And how to gain the protein if i don't eat meat ? Thanks If you are very much over weight, I would think vegetarian diet is the best choice for you because you can help your body reduce the fat that make you over weight. But if you are not over weight or under weight, then eating a combined meat and vegetarian diet is more ideal for you.On the other hand, if you are ok with your weight but having heart or other health problems like high cholestrol and so on... then you should eat more vegetable and fruits but cut down on red meat, white meat without the fat can be eaten in moderation to provide the protein your body needs.

Endling a long distance relationship.? Okay, so I live 9 hours away from my girlfriend. She is always complaining that she never gets to see me, because I live so far away, obviously. I always tell her when I will see her next, and I keep my word, and go see her. But its expensive, and now I'm going to school and I don't have time to drive for 9 hours to see her. \n\nI want to break up with her. I don't want to break up with her over the phone, because I know you're not supposed to do that. But I don't have the money to go and see her in person to do it, I'm in college and completely broke.\n\nSo how do I do it? Do I just say its not working out, and its time for it to end? She says shes in love with me, but I'm not in love with her, and I've never told her that I love her  (because to do so would be a lie).\n\nI just wish there were some way to do this without hurting her, but I guess I've come to realize that no matter what, i'm going to hurt her, and there is no easy way to do this.\n\nMan this sucks. Suck it up be a man and tell her how you feel. Or, call the newspaper, print your obit and have a friend mail it to her.

I need to know more about human parvo virus?   What is fifth disease?\nFifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, is a contagious viral illness that is much more common in children than adults. It is also known as "slapped cheek disease" because of the distinctive rash that some people develop on the face.\n\nFifth disease is spread mostly by coughs and sneezes. Generally, people can spread fifth disease only when flulike symptoms are present and before a rash develops. Some people who have fifth disease, such as those who have certain blood disorders or impaired immune systems, may be contagious for a longer time. \n\nWhat causes fifth disease?\nFifth disease is caused by a virus called human parvovirus B19. \n\nWhat are the symptoms?\nThe incubation period—the time from exposure to the virus until symptoms develop—is 4 to 20 days. Initial symptoms usually resemble a mild flu (generally without fever), sometimes followed by a bright red rash on the face, and later a lace-like rash on the body. The rash usually fades within 2 to 5 days and may reappear with exposure to sunlight, warm temperatures, or stress. After the rash appears, your child is no longer contagious and can return to school or daycare.\n\nJoint pain and swelling, lasting several weeks or even months, and headache may also occur. Adults develop these symptoms more often than children. \n\nNot all people with fifth disease get a rash or feel sick.\n\nHow is it diagnosed?\nFifth disease is diagnosed through a medical history and physical examination by a health professional. A diagnosis of fifth disease is generally easier if a person develops the distinctive rash associated with the infection.\n\nHow is it treated?\nIn uncomplicated cases, home treatment (including rest, fluids, and pain relievers) is usually the only care needed for fifth disease. If complications develop, close monitoring by a health professional or hospitalization may be required.\n\nComplications of fifth disease\nIn fifth disease, the body stops producing red blood cells for a short time. This usually does not cause a problem for an otherwise normally healthy child or adult. However, it can become a serious threat for people who have blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia. These people can develop transient aplastic crisis, a rapid worsening of existing anemia that usually lasts 7 to 10 days. People who have transient aplastic anemia can become very sick; symptoms include fever, lethargy, rapid heart rate, and rapid breathing.\n\nPeople who have impaired immune systems who become infected with fifth disease may develop a chronic parvovirus B19 infection that can lead to severe anemia.\n\nMedical treatments for complications of fifth disease\nPregnant women and people who have impaired immune systems or blood disorders are at risk for developing complications from fifth disease.\n\nTreatment for pregnant women\nIn very rare cases, a fetus that becomes infected with parvovirus B19 may develop severe anemia and swelling, a condition called fetal hydrops. The mother and fetus should be closely monitored with fetal ultrasounds to detect this condition. \n\nWhen fetal hydrops is detected, the fetus may be treated with blood transfusions while in the uterus, although this is not usually necessary.\n\nSome babies born to mothers who were infected with fifth disease during pregnancy may also be treated with blood transfusions.\n\nTreatment for people who have blood or immune disorders\nPeople who have blood disorders that cause anemia (such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia) may require blood transfusions if a rapid worsening of existing anemia (called transient aplastic anemia) develops.\n\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be given to people who have impaired immune systems to prevent a chronic parvovirus B19 infection and severe anemia.

Does the no. of belt or its length in belt drive have something to do with speed computations?   Length has nothing to do with the belts speed of course. Length only makes sure they reach all pulleys involved. The speed of any belt is based on diameter of the pulleys they turn and the driving forces (drive pulley) to the belt.\nOf course the more or wider belts you have the better the grip to the pulleys if high torgue loads on the pulleys are expected.

USB external drive causes Windows XP Home to freeze? I have a 200GB Western Digital HD with a USB-to-IDE external enclosure. Everytime when I plug the USB cable into to my Toshiba L25-S119 notebook computer, the Windows XP Home hang/freeze. The following are some information about my computer hardware, OS, and HD:\n\nComputer maker and model: Toshiba Satellite L25-S119\nHardware information (general):\nCPU: Intel Celeron M 370 (1.5GHz) 1MB L2, 400MHz FSB\nRAM: 768MB (256 + 512) PC4200 DDR2 533MHz SDRAM 1.8V SODIMM\nChipset: ATI RADEON XPRESS 200M Chipset\nSouthbridge: ATI SB400\nInternal HD: 60GB FUJITSU MHV2060AH, 5400RPM, EIDE (ATA-6)\nOptical drive: MATS.H.I.TA DVD/CDRW UJDA770\n\nOS and BIOS information:\nOS: Windows XP Home with SP2\nBIOS: Toshiba v1.80 (12/14/05)\n\nExternal USB HD: Western Digital 200GB HD (IDE)in NTFS with 2 partitions. (approximately 150 + 50 GB)\n\nExternal Enclosure: Metal Gear Box with AC-to-DC power supply.\n\n\nOther information:\n\nThe external USB HD works fine with my another two desktop PCs: Windows XP Pro SP2 and Windows 98 SE (with NTFS for Win98 and USB driver). And, it also works perfectly with my friends' Sony and HP notebook computers (Win xp Home).\n\nMy first thought was a driver problem. However, I checked the drivers it installed in this notebook were same as my other PCs. \n\nI tried Windows XP Pro SP2 clean installation on this computer, but the problem still occured. Therefore, it is not some problems with the Home edition of Windows XP.\n\nThe external enclosure has a DC power supply, so power won't be the problem.\n\nI have tried all my three USB ports. All the three USB ports works fine with my SanDisk 1GB Flash drive.\n\nI did a CHKDSK using my desktop PC, and the disk was fine.\n\nI also uninstalled and reinstalled all the USB and disk drivers, but it still the same.(set DEVMGR_SHOW_NONPRESENT_DEVICES=1 devmgmt.msc)\n\nThe only situation that it works with this computer is when I boot the computer from Knoppix Linux CD. So, I guess this is not a hardware problem. How do you guys think? Thanks in advance. I discovered a configuration mismatch\nCPU: Intel Celeron M 370 (1.5GHz) 1MB L2, 400MHz FSB\nRAM: 768MB (256 + 512) PC4200 DDR2 533MHz \n\nThe clock frequency of the RAM may not be higher than the clock frequency of the FSB. Every manufacturer of a mainboard with FSB 400MHz would recommend RAM of the types PC2100 or PC2700.\nThis might not be the reason for your hangs/freezes, but the timing of PC4200 DDR RAMs on a 400MHz FSB is critical anyway.

I'm trying to find a site to download windows 2000 on to cdrom to install on my computer. NO UPDATES? I can't update windows if it isn't installed so I need to install a full version of windows 2000 Well, firstly, that's very illegal, and you probably shouldn't do it. But I won't stop you. And I doubt you will be able to find a website where you can download the full version of Windows 2000. But you could always try downloading a p2p software, such as limewire, and then downloading it from there. And then after you download it, DON'T open it. Scan it for viruses first, and then if its clean, burn it to a disk, and you should be set.
If Drugs like Ritalin do improve woking skills and concentraion then why not give it to all persons?   Ritalin (stimulant) works because it stimulates a certain part of the brain to work at a minimum level of activity to control other parts of the brain. It only is really effective in this way in people whose executive function area is already working below normal. It doesn't do the same thing with people who are  'normal'. It only speeds them up, but only at dosages above the ADD/ADHD levels which are usually used. There are other side effects of using stimulants, like insomnia, indigestion, dry eyes....
Why are the oceans salty and rivers not, what keeps them separate?   The rivers are not salty because an important source of their water is rain, which does not have salt.  But the water that runs through the land picks up dissolved salts and carries it to the ocean, where it accumulates over time.  That is the water that evaporates off the surface and becomes the rain that falls on the land to feed the rivers.  The salt does not evaporate, and is left behind in the ocean to accumulate.  So the salt from the land is gradually transferred to the ocean by the rain and by rivers that run to the ocean, etc.

if ADHD possibly comes from genes is it possible that most of their children have ADHD?   I have 4 children... My husband is ADHD and I am ADD... we did not realize this until we had our son tested for ADHD. I do know that when we started to see the signs in our son we started to realize that the problems and certain things we did as kids were the same things our son does. Our girls who are next in line have ADD and ADHD symptoms. The same symptoms my son had not to mention that they look like mirror images of ourselves. We have a small house and our house gets pretty loud and wild. We are a happy family. My husband and I believe that his siblings may have some of the same symptoms. So in my opinion and experience yes it is possible.

The average was even more astonishing: $930,700, up about 10 percent. Ten years ago, million-dollar partner paydays were limited to two or three firms. No more. Thirty-two of the firms on this year's chart enjoyed average profits per partner of $1 million or more, and they aren't just the usual New York and Los Angeles suspects. Bingham McCutchen, Dechert, and Howrey Simon Arnold & White were all over $1 million for the first time, each with profitability jumps of 14 percent or more. Partnership was very, very good to a lot of big-firm lawyers in 2003. \n-- taken from the article referenced below.\n\nNote that these are averages for partners, generally, at these firms, not managing partners, who tend to make at the top of the scale.

Are muslim women allowed to wear jeans and trousers? Considering they're loose-fitted and not tight. i agree with lynda, as far as the clothes dont let the man lust over them, its all good. Loose fitted jeans and shirts do just fine for other men as its very unattractive. You can wear anything for your man when you and him are all alone.

Lara peaked in his first 40 matches with an average over 60, Tendulkar, like Ponting, peaked from 50-100 matches.
i might see him this weekend!? i might see my ex bf this weekend and after him saying he dont even want to be friends any more should i try to talk to him or what/ because i have been try ing to get back with him for a long time now cuz i love him!! How can you love someone who said that to you?  He doesn't even want to be your friend.  What kind of relationship would that be?  It certainly wouldn't be very good for you.  He would use you for your love.\n\nYour feelings are hard to get over.  I've been there.  Trust me, they will go away in time.  Just keep yourself busy with other friends and activities.\n\nIf you can't avoid seeing him, and I strongly suggest you do until you get over your feelings, just be calm and polite.  Don't initiate conversation other than "Hi", and if he asks you questions, answer simply.  As far as he knows, you are doing just fine without him.  That will make him hurt, just a little.  Don't throw yourself at him, because that will just make him run.

what is clostridium botulinum and what is recent research related to it, also it's use in biological warfare   Yeah, what he said - almost. C. botulinum is a bacteria which produces the neurotoxin botulin. When we ingest this toxin, we get botulism. Its possible uses in biological warfare as a paralytic and death-causing agent are frightening. Interestingly, Botox is made from botulinum toxin A, one of the poisons made by these bacteria.
Is applying the laws of the land (America) towards minors discrimination? I am glad their are laws concerning minors. I believe they are in place to protect the Adults from their actions because they are not mature enough to make their own decisions. I have a petition to regulate the minors in love & romance. Yahoo is doing a study of their presence, the content of the questions and answers in this forum. Thank "GOD". No, someone needs to protect them from themselves.
i have had diareah problems for about 3 months should i see a docter? and is it alcohole related? i have been drinking a little more than usual yes, you could have Irritable Bowl Sndrome.  I have it and it took us 5 months to figure out!  Your doctor would probably want a colonoscopy done, and I warn you they make you drink this nasty laxitive that will clear out whatever is left in your colon.  You will only be able to drink clear liquid the day before, broth, popscicles, jello that sort of thing but nothing red because it can temporarly stain the colon and make the doctor think you have internal bleeding. They generally knock you completly out and you may be a bit sore after words but its worth it to make sure you don't have something worse.\nPlease cut back on drinking too, it could be causing it and you will get liver problems in the future if you don't  slow down! \nGood luck

Are your eyes "on God" from the time you wake up until the time you go to bed?   It is obvious, AnxiusVigilans , that your hostility toward Christianity, coupled with your long list of questions regarding everyone elses beliefs, that you believe you can cast doubt on any believer so they may become a professional skeptic like yourself.\nYour defensive posturing indicates your fear of being wrong, and afraid God may exist, and we'll be in His presence in paradise forever, and your slanted dismissal of Gods existence will lead you to agonizing eternal punishment. I pray you'll stop being so defensive and dismissive.

Is the fight for the Holy Land of Jerusalem still in effect today?   Yes. Hamas refuses to acknowledge that Isreal can even exist as a nation. The "Palistinian state" wants to divide Jerusalem in half. The half with the muslim mosque  on it to go to them, and the other part to Isreal. But Isreal says Jerusalem will not be divided again, that mount moriah belongs to them and it will stay that way.
how to get a random number in ASP.Net? how to get a random number in ASP.Net When you are going for a random number always remember that the computer does not generate truly random numbers. It simply uses an set structure to pick them. To make the number seem more random, just remember that the odds of selecting the random number at the same time is virutally impossible. Therefore for truly random numbers try this in C#\n\nRandom rand = new Random(DateTime.Now.Millisecond);\n//Millisecond is the seed value.\n//Then if you want to select from a range, enter it like this:\nint num = rand.Next(minValue, maxValue);\n\n//To select a number between 0 and a max value use this:\nint num1 = rand.Next(maxValue);\n\n//To select any random number, use this:\nint num2 = rand.Next();\n\nIf you are using VB, just make sure to use the seed and everything else is pretty much the same.\nGood Luck!

Fear, Pride  and Prejudice to create a religion !? Tell me if you agree to this! (not aimed at any specifical religion nor disrespecting anyone)\nIf i wanted to create a religion what would i make it like, would i put my pride in it ? my fears ? Of course\nIf i would want to be the only one worshipped i'd say "worship no other"\nIf i was rejected by females i'd say "the female is a sinner she is lower than man and a man can have a lot of women just not viceversa"\nIf i wanted to use fear on others "if you don't belive in me you will go to hell"\nIf i wanted to play on people's fears "i will always be with you anywhere and see what ur doing"\nIf i would want to protect my daughter "don't have sex before marriage"\nIf i would wanna get rich fast "give ur money to me cuz you won't need it and it's a good thing"\nIf i would wanna have a lot of violent people ready to act "the one that won't belive in me need to be destroyed"\nIf i wanna feel respected "don't take my name in vain"\nDon't u think the makers of religions were megalomaniacs? I AGREE THAT :\n-if there was no god no one would have claimed to be one!\n\n-If I was an important person I would have deserved to be respected. (How do you think god should be treated like?)\n\n-If I were god I wouldn’t have needed women! (god is thought of as male and referred to as male, but god is unique not like creatures in my religion) \n\n-If I warn people they get some punishment if they did something specific then they took it lightly and still defied me they deserve that punishment. (Just like the head of a school and a pain-in-the-butt student, won’t the student be put in detention?at least?) It’s all about consequences. \n\n-If people will be afraid god is with them every where means they are doing wrongful deeds, why don’t they be happy god is with them? I’d love for the ones I like to be with me all the time- almost! Counting out the bathroom time and that :P\n \n-If I had a daughter I would have wanted to protect her from AIDS and other sex transferred diseases and premarital pregnancy of course! Coz I love my kid and I don’t want her to suffer or be just a sex object having one night stands. I will let her know she is precious.\n \n-If I was poor and needed money I would have needed help. If people who have extra money won’t help those who die from hunger how would life be on earth?(I think we know already :(, try spending 1 dollar or even less to a poor person or in some charity organization, mind only your good intentions, in not long a time you will find that you got it back and more! I did that any way and it worked many times. It’s like god tells u if u help others I will make others help you, one more gig or a part time job or something u never expect, and you’ll get what u spent back into your pocket and more!) \n \n-If someone destroys what I gave them I’ll be sad, like giving someone a book or something and they tear it or something, even by accident. If you accept god as the one who gave us the earth and the trees and our souls and bodies, he will not accept us destroying all that. (You really have wrong ideas about religions you need to read more, not only this point but also the women being sinners and that too)\n \n-If some one swears at me I will tell him not to because it’s disrespectful and I’m only a human being and I’m not a president or something. Does that mean I am a sick person?! Shouldn’t we all treat each other nicely?\n \n-If I were god I would tell my creatures to live in peace.\n\n-If human beings are intelligent creatures why don’t they understand SIGNS? we can't see electricity but we see its effect.\n\nOne last thing, what would you people think of me if I tell you I SAW A COMPUTER MAKE ITSELF?! Or I SAW A BUILDING BUILD ITSELF?!!

I want to renew my life! what should I do and how?where to start? thanks for any advice! :) You're awesome!!  You know what I do if I want to make changes, I write down everything i am unhappy with. I write down what it is I want to change, how I am going to change it, I give myself a target date(goal setting) :D Remember that you don't want to do it all at once because that is when you get discouraged. Set your target dates in a reasonable time frame and make sure they are far enough from each other. Changes don't happen over night you have to work at it and make them happen. A little at a time and don't get discouraged. You will run into challenges, but don't see them as stumbling blocks, see them as stepping stones, we learn from everything. \n\nHope it helps :) I hope this is what you are looking for. \n\nGood luck two thumbs and four paws up to you!
very very intersting ....? there is some one who is name is ALABAMAMSER is alawyes choose BRIAN'S answers as a best answer so i think they are the same person who is trying to win in realy realu sely way \nALABAMAMSER-BRIAN are both in the yahoo answer you can looke for them and you will know that im telling the true .\nany way i want to know your opinion about this and do you think he is the only person who is doing that \n\nim sorry if my question will be not understood for many of you.\nand im sorry BRIAN You're right, Sweetie.  Actually, he has 3 ID's.\nHe is also 'alabamamissy' if you go in and check his answered questions you will see all of the questions asked by her & he did the same thing....asked a question, answered as BrianL and then chose himself as the best answer.\nUnfortunately, some people don't have a life so...\nthey do the best they can at making themselves one.\nThis probably makes him feel very important to ... himself.\nHe is a very sad human being.\n\nBrianL is Alabamaser and Alabamamissy - he unfortunately uses MS as his play point which is very sad and ignorant.\nHe probably has more...but I'm not wasting any more moments of my life on him.  He's already threatened to harrass me on all my questions and answers.  So probably expect one on here from him.\n\nDon't worry about it, Sweetie.  The only thing that bothers me with him doing it is that he has his questions and answers lined up...then when someone else answers to the best of their ability....he calls thems names or tells them how ignorant they are....which just makes him the ignorant one. \n\nIt's not like he's going to win A Million bucks or anything.  Think of it this way....he's just wasting three times as much of his life than we are on this silly site.  Lol.\n\nBesides...I just went into his open questions and busted him...just for you! \n\n\nLighten up, Sweetie.\nYou must be very young to let such small things bother you.\n\nHave a great weekend...go out and enjoy life and get off of this silly computer!!\n\nBy the way... you make a GREAT detective.  Might be an occupation you want to pursue.
if a funeral home is having a boom in business, are they happy or sad?   Both. Since they are in the funeral industry, they are happy to have the business. However, seeing the grief that people endure every day takes its toll. Very few morticians would say that they are happy to see people die, and caring for the dead can be somewhat draining due to the intensity of emotion shown by the survivors. But, to be realistic, every time someone dies, it puts food on the funeral director's table. That's the reality of the business. Death, for them, equals a paycheck.

Can a 6 mos. old infant eat plain rice already?   Usually normal babies this age can begin eating strained or pureed foods at first.  Plain rice could be difficult or dangerous for the baby if it is still firm as he/she could choke on it.  It would be best to ask your Doctor for advice pertaining to your baby in case there are some special concerns and for a general nutrition plan.  Also, there are many good books and pamphlets about this available from WIC or at your pediatrician's office.
If men are scared of marriage, why are most divorces filed by women? Most stats I've seen indicate that 70-75% of divorces are filed by women.\n\nI've also seen stats that put infidelity by men at about 60% and infidelity by women at about 40%, with women catching up to the infidelity rate of men.\n\nSo why do you think women, who typically complain than men are afraid of comittment, seem to want divorce two to three times more than do men?\n\nIt seems to me that men are more comitted to marriage than women.  Comments? Actually, you're right. Women ARE more likely to leave a marriage than a man. I read somewhere, long time ago (when my mom left my dad), something that said that women's needs change during the course of a relationship, while men's needs primarily stayed the same (and yes, this does include the phyiscal needs). \n\nFor example, a woman who falls in love and marries a man because he has an exotic job may decide five years later that the job "isn't enough" because she now needs someone who can be at home at 5:15 every single night to help take care of the kids. Her needs changed; his didn't. She married him because she ALSO loved the job - not just him - and now she doesn't love the job any more, and so, by consequence, she no longer loves him. Irreconcilable differences, you know.\n\nMen, on the other hand, will fall in love and marry a woman who happens to HAVE an exotic job. If she then decides to stay home and have kids, he will often stay dedicated to her because he "made that commitment" and will stay the course. If he does stray - as you admit some men do - it's often because the woman's needs have changed... and half the time, she's straying, too!\n\nMen also have been taught by their fathers, over the generations, that women are to be cared for (which I agree with) no matter what. Even though women were "liberated" 30 years ago, men are still being taught this value, and apparently they're listening! Women have taken this "liberation" and used it to their advantage as a gender, allowing themselves the freedom of escaping from home responsibilities that men have shouldered for centuries.\n\nNow... that's my opinion.... anyone else?
Why do so many people believe in God, and yet deny the existance of other supernatural phenomena? God is an invisible being who has not spoken to his people (in a documented form) and it is socially acceptable to believe in God.  However, society frowns on people who see spirits, hear voices, and have visions.  What is the difference? well, since God is an omnipitant creator, then he can choose what events to take place. and yes, this so called "supernatural" stuff does happen, all the time. Sad thing is, allot of people cover it up, because they dont want to admit that there is no way it could hapen other then there being some one placed over us.(God)You may call me krazy, but i HAVE heard Gods voice, he DOES still speak to us. And no im not on drugs and im in my right mind.

Help! i have a girl friend and she have told our love to her father. Her father was not accepting likely w 2 d have spoke to him 3 times and i have also told that we had sex and i wl not marry other girl as i feel she is my wife. Though telling this her father is telling that he will take this issue to his relations and if they accept he will accept for our marriage else he will not. Iam unable 2 think a life without her and she loves me like anything. For the past 20 days they are not letting her outside(even to office) and not giving the phone calls to her. She also not made any call still now and iam getting mad. Iam a typical guy who always think only one girl in my life and i don't want to take my life with some other girl. Her father told to me that he will go to his native in april and let me know the output in the month of may. I think he will prob take her to native and live her there. I don't know her native place also. I want to talk to her but if they come to iam in the line the problem will explode much. Pls advice what to do in this regard. Thxin advance for ur help and advice. Hopefully, you are both over 18.  If she loves you like you say, then as an adult she is going to have to make a choice.  He can't force her to go somewhere without her consent.  While I realize that her culture is different, she is going to have to stand up to her father.  Unfortunately, if she doesn't stand up to him and goes with him, then there is not a lot you can do except forget her.  Do not do anything drastic or stupid.  You could end up in trouble.  The next step is up to her.  Good luck!

is becoming a Lawyer worth it ? Any Lawyers, if you could do it over, would you become a lawyer again ? Only pursue becoming a lawyer if you are doing it for the right reasons.  I think the "right" reasons differ for everyone, but I can tell you what I think the "wrong" reasons are:  money, prestige, and/or any reason not having to do with personal satisfaction and happiness.  \n\nI don't regret my legal education, but what I do is not glamorous, and it can be very difficult and stressful.  Just read an article about the incidence of substance abuse, mental illness, etc. in the lawyer population as opposed to the general population.  There are a lot of unhealthy, unhappy lawyers.\n\nIf you go for it, then make sure you have hobbies that you keep up with after practice.  Don't let practice swallow you whole.  Also, despite the prevailing view that firm practice is the ONLY practice, make sure you consider what are currently considered "alternative" forms of practice that may suit you.\n\nI'm finally in what many would consider an alternative form of practice, and I still have difficulties and stress, but I'm much, much happier and actually enjoy practice now.  Do what makes you feel like a real person (cause firm life can make you feel like a soulless drone).\n\nGood luck.
Why is mercury a liquid? Other reason than molecular kinetic theory.? In the case of Bromine it can be explained by covalent bonding theory, but i have yet found an explanation for the case of mercury. Must be somethin special with its outer valence shell? Just about everything in chemistry has to do with the outer valence shell.  This is no exception.\n\nThe metals in this row (period 6) basically bond with each other using their s and d orbitals.  As with everything else, this works best when you have 1 electron in each (e.g. H2) and worst when they're already full (e.g. He2).  Mercury has them all (it's in column 12 = 2s + 10d), and therefore VERY poor bonding.  In constrast, tungsten (W) has half of them, and exceptional bonding (MP-3422 C), which is why it's used as the filament in light bulbs.\n\nSo why are Cd and Zn solids if they're the same column as Hg?  It has to do mostly with the size (larger = further = weaker bonding), but is best described using band theory.  I'd recommend looking there.  \n\nP.S. Things wierd when there are this many electrons in one atom, like yellow gold.
in the nba, isnt it the rule that the hometeam should wear light colored jersey? last night in mia it wasnt.y?   Its not a rule... Look at the alternate jerseys this year... Detroit's is a dark red and they have worn that at home many times... But when they do, the other team wears thier lighter colored jerseys... So i think if they do wear the dark ones, the other team must wear a light jersey
How Does Frequency affect on the emmition of electrons in photo electric effect ? i know that E=hV(new(frequency)) So please explain the effect .THNX the photo electric occurs when a light icidence on material , the electrons are attached to material nuclei by binding energy , the electrons will liberated out material if the intensity ( energy / unit area) of incident light is more than binding energy this is done by particular frequency called threshold frequency

am i the only one who suffers from accentism in america or what? because i sound different, no one talks to me.......\nits so unfair........... Don't get down on yourself. I live in Southern California but was raised in east Texas, so I've got a thick Southern accent. Initially, people assumed I was unintelligent and had no inkling of popular culture. Instead of withdrawing and letting them intimidate me, I spoke out in every class and tried to make as many friends as I could. Change their perceptions. You can do it!

What is the animal responsible for the most human deaths? If u get it right u got my vote fa sure. Mosquitos are MOST DEFINITELY animals. They are part of the taxonomic kingdom animalia.\n\nMany of the respondants are correct. Mosquitos have caused more human deaths than any other animal because they spread the parasites that cause malaria. \n\nRats spread the parasites that carry the bacteria that cause bubonic plague but malaria has killed more people than plague.

Where does Access store the table created when a query is run?   The query returns results that may look like a *table* but in fact it's a temporary recordset that isn't *stored* anywhere.  You can export to MS Excel and save the results in an Excel file - but within Access, the query results aren't stored / saved anywhere.\n\nYou could change the query to a Make Table Query - and then the results would be placed in a table when the query is run.  To change the query from a select query (the default query type) to a make table query - open the query in design mode, select Query from the menu - and select Make Table Query.  Enter a table name (any name you decide - if it doesn't exist it'll be created).  Good luck.

Do you think you would be able to sleep at night knowing that you said or wrote something, like some of these? question's & answers on here.I would be so scared that God wouldn't deal with my heart again and that I might die in that state of anger and rebelion. If there is a judgement as we think, I believe our entire lives will be considered - not just the state we are in before we die. Alot of people who regularly did awful things to others, never did a thing to correct the problems they caused, but thought asking God for forgiveness one time was sufficient - probably went to hell. I.e., you can fool people, but try fooling God.

what should i do if this boy asked to marry me but i didnt give him a answer. im not sure yet but i luv him.? please be specific with the answers please This same situation occured with my wife and I.  I asked her to marry me fairly early in our relationship, and she was not prepared for marriage yet.  Instead of rejection, however, she explained her feelings (that she did love me, but was not ready), and we agreed to wait a while longer.  After another year we had both found good jobs, finished school and settled in nicely together.  We then had a wonderful wedding (plus she got a MUCH better engagement and wedding ring! ;) )\n\nJust be honest and straightforward.  If he loves you as much as you love him, he will wait until you are ready.  Hope this helps, and best of luck!

How do I make copies of DVD's using my new DVD burner? Actually, I am sure I can figure out the process for the most part.  I haven't tried to do it yet.  I am just curious what kind of issues I will run into with copyright protection.  I bet that there are programs out there that over-ride copyright encryption.  Which is the best one?  Where can I download it? Use DVD decrypt along with DVD shrink. Both are free, just do a search on the net. Of course it's just for personal backups, right?
Any one ever had atrial fibrilation and still have heart palpatations and flutters even when Dr says seems OK? I get such anxiety and depression over this that I sometimes wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up!! I have never felt the same since the incident and Dr. keep telling me I'm OK.  Just wondering if there are any others like me out there?? Atrial fibrillation can be serious at times, especially if it is new in a patient and there is no clinical history of it.  On the other hand, if A-fib does not affect your normal routine I would not worry about it.  The negative effects of having A-fib are not that great, especially since the anatomical structure of the heart allows blood to basically fall out of the atria and into the ventricles.  Just from gravity alone, you should be getting about 60% of the blood in your atria falling down into your ventricles.  Although not highly effecient, it is manageable for living a mostly normal life.  If your doctor seems to be ok with allowing your A-fib to persist without any medical intervention, he probably sees no reason why you cannot sustain your normal activities with it therefore saving you time, pain, and money.  Hospitalizations are expensive, cardioversions are painful, and all of these plus drugs cost money.  If you don't trust your doctor's opinion and the advice of the answers you have received here, go to another city to another cardiologist and get his opinion.  Just don't mention anything that the other doctor said and take the new doctor's opinion and make a decision from that.  I see people everyday that go home from this hospital with persistent A-fib after cardioversions and every rhythm regulating drug on the market shoved down their throat, and they all seem to be just fine.  No matter what anyone tells you though, doctors, nurses, friends, family; make this decision on your own and go with your insticts and whatever will make you feel comfortable.

You can also rub your chest down with Mentholatum at night to loosen it to help it come up easier if it feels tight in your chest.

when your arm feel funny? my arm fell like shake and could not stop it Did you feel any cramping at all? Sometimes this can happen from cramping, otherwise Spasticity (muscle spasms) tends to affects larger areas of the body - arm, leg, trunk, neck.. Which is what it sounds like you had/have.\nHere is a little information on muscle spasms in this is the case. \nhttp://www.alsa-or.org/treatment/MuscleSpasms.htm\n\nAs for what Fuschiahedgehog said above\nThat is just absurd to say "Could be anything from a seizure to a stroke" who seems to think they are a doctor.\nRidiculous!\nHere are the signs of a stroke to better educate yourself... I can almost see "Seizure" because epilepsy causes muscle spasms/seizures which can cause an arm to shake out of control, but usually there are more signs of a seizure than just that:\nhttp://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4742\n\n\nAnyways, you are better off seeing a doctor other than reading what others have to say who have no medical background.\n\nEdit:\nFrom reading all of your questions I would strongly suggest you see a doctor right away... Fever and involuntary jerking/shaking can be a danger and something has to be causing it. If Insurance is a problem, there should be some form of clinic near you that can work with you.. Also an ER in a hospital can't turn you away and won't charge you on the spot.. usually they will work out some sort of payment plan as well.
Are folding bikes any good? Are they lightweight? Are they comfortable for trail use? Do they come in women's models? How much do they cost? How much do they weigh? My opinion you are better off buying a decent Trek brand bike.Folding bikes are very heavy.

who made the first ever maze?   "THE earliest structure of any kind to which we find the word labyrinth applied was a huge building situated in the North of Egypt, a land always noted for its stupendous monuments, and was probably constructed more than 2000 years before the commencement of the Christian era."\n\nFrom "Mazes and Labyrinths", Ch. 2.  (See link below.)\n\nPerhaps this was the inspiration for the famed Labyrinth of Greek myth, which supposedly was constructed by Daedalus\nfor King Minos of Crete, to hold the Minotaur.
How far will ILLIONIS (men) make it in the NCAA Tornament?   Illinois is good, but they don't have the depth in their roster like the big time schools have.

Does this mean I still like him or what? or what...

i would like to start a business and would like to get a government grant show me how?   It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n"The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for "students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices." Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.
How do you feel about child care centers in highschools? I'm doing a persuasive speech and my topic is child care centers in high schools for the students who are parents. Does anyone have an opinion on the topic or any experience with this? I think they are great for student who are looking to work with children. It is great opportunity for students looking to get into the teaching profession, for them to get some beginning experience working with young children. We had on in my high school and it was great. I planned lessons and activities for the young children and it was my first teaching experience, I learned a lot and it only helped me in the future attain my job, I now teach kindergarten!
When is Brett Favre going to announce his decision? I am not asking if he should retire, because he shouldnt. He has the best arm in the NFL today. Thats right I said it. The Packers are going to the Super Bowl whether anyone likes it or not! Yeah I heard Saturday too, but on April Fools Day?? It will be hard to know if it is true or not. He also might wait until the 6th and announce it at his golf tourny.  I would hope he wont go out on a losing season but if he does he still will be remembered as a great quarterback who won a Superbowl in Green Bay.

On a world map, is your country spotted in the middle?

What Causes a brief episode of cyanosis maybe lasting 20 seconds to a minute with palpitations and tingling ? I experience these brief episodes . I feel very anxious when I am having one {like I am dying}. After my heart slows down and my color comes back I feel shakey for about 30 minutes. I can't relate these episodes to any particular thing they just happen and they are very frightening. If you have experienced this or know someone who has please write me . Thanks True cyanosis indicates that this part of your body is not getting enough blood. That's why it turns blue. You could have a heart problem. It is not unusual to have anxiety along with heart problems. Go to your doctor right away to determine what's going on. You should not diagnose this yourself.
What do you need to major on in order to be a manga artist?   I'd try graphic design, visual arts, take some courses in Japanese culture[hey it couldn't hurt ;-D] and anything that teaches you how to capture the feelings of real people, real things in a stylized manner would get you there.  \nI'm sure you don't need to major in anything.  you need to have a background in creative writing or just be creative enough that a publisher like Viz wants to buy your stuff.  the same thing will apply to the visual aspect.
Can the Miami Dolphins win the Super Bowl in 2007? If the Miami Dolphins were to win Super Bowl XLI next year, they would be the first team (that I am aware of) that would win on their home field at Dolphin Stadium.

what do i do about my date for prom? my prom is in 9 days and i have no date! my friend is my last hope for a date but when my friend asked him to take me he said he was broke and didn't want to go anyways! my friend (who asked him) still thinks i should try to get him to go, suggest splitting costs, etc. cuz she was going to help me find a date but she'll be in new york for the next week! should i try to talk him into it and how? Yeah ask him to go with you, by yourself and splitting the cost is a good idea. The two of you are friends there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to enjoy each others company, unless you're thinking of someone else while you're together. Don't let this be a mercy date for either of you, make sure that the two of you can really have fun. It's not necessary to be open to other possibilities.\n\nEnjoy the Prom!

what were the purpose of the "guilds" in the middle ages?   Merchant guilds controlled the trade in the town by setting prices, et cetera.\n\nCraft guilds regulated the quality, working hours, and conditions of its members.  There were 3 levels of guild members:  Masters, journeymen, and apprentices.\n\nApprentices worked for approx. 7 yrs to learn the craft, then became journeymen.  the journeymen worked approx. 7 years, then submitted a sample to the guild masters for approval. If the item was approved, they became Masters.
what characteristics of beets make them a useful experimental model for studying cellular membranes?   Since the pigment within the membrane of the beets are colored red, it's good to test the stress caused on the membrane. The more damage to the membrane, the more color it gives off. Put the beet in the solution that you are going to test in.\n\nPersonally, I tested heat and acid. \nIn general, extreme heat will cause more stress on the membrane than extreme heat. This can be easily observed by the naked eye. \nAcetone has a greater ability to dissolve lipids than methanol, the acetone solvent will cause greater stress on the membrane

If a neutrino has no mass why would it be limited to the speed of light? I admit that this question comes from a layman. Einstein showed that the following is true:\n(m^2)(c^4) = e^2 - (p * c)^2\nwhere m is mass, e is energy, p is momentum, and c is the speed of light.  (It's possible to derive this, but not without a ton of explanation and math.)\n\nFor any particle that has no mass, m = 0.  This means that:\ne = (p*c)\n\nHe also showed that v = (p * c^2) / e, where v is velocity.\n(Again, it can be derived with pain.)\n\nSo, when e = pc, you get v = c.  What this means is that when all of a particle's energy is due to momentum (and none due to mass), the velocity the particle travels HAS to be c.  That's the mathematical explanation.

what is  friendship?   Friendship is a human relationship which involves mutual knowledge, esteem, and affection. Friends will welcome each other's company and exhibit loyalty towards each other, often to the point of putting the other's interests before one's own. Their tastes will be similar and may converge, and they will share enjoyable activities. They will also engage in mutually helping behavior, such as exchange of advice and the sharing of hardship. A friend is someone who may often demonstrate reciprocating and reflective behaviors. Yet for many, friendship is nothing more than the trust that someone or something will not harm them.
what is reduction reaction?   A reduction reaction is only half of a reaction. It must occur with an oxidation reaction to be a full reaction, to be called a redox reaction.

What are the advantages/diadvantages of using heavy iron cast skillets vs. lightweight skillets?   There are a whole host of ways that heavy cast iron skillets may be better than (or worse) than using a lightweight skillet, but given that this is probably a question that wants you concentrate of physical properities of materials  I will limit my comments to that area.\n\nA heavy cast iron skillet has more MASS than a lightweight skillet of any kind. Therefore it will heat up more slowly and transfer changes in heat less rapidly. This may be an advantage when cooking foods that one wants evenly browned/seared, as those kinds of task require lots of even heat. This same "slow to heat & cool" property might be a disadvantage when trying to quickly boil or evaporate liquid. It would also be a disadavantage when trying cook delicate foods quickly, as in making candy, where precise temperatire control helps to prevent overcooking.\n\nFurther, uncoated cast iron is chemically reactive -- it will rapidly oxidize/rust and so must be coated with oil to prevent it from deteriorating. Even using it to cook foods that are acidic (such as tomatoes or vinegar) will also cause chemical interactions.

Where can I see Kelly Clarkson on American Idol? Is there anywhere I can see the season where Kelly Clarkson was on American Idol? Is it on DVD or something?\n\n=P\n\nI know this is a stupid question but I really want to watch it! I don't know that they have put the American Idol seasons out on DVD yet and I don;t know if they actually will.  But if you go to the provided link there's highlights from season 1-4 on DVD.  I'm sure there are clips of Kelly on that.
Part I: With your own beliefs as a guide, write one paragraph to answer the following questions: What should s A Midwest biologist has conducted numerous studies demonstrating that simple organisms such as worms and paramecia can learn through conditioning. It occurs to her that perhaps she could condition fertilized human ova, to provide a dramatic demonstration that abortions destroy adaptable, living human organisms. This possibility appeals to her, as she is ardently opposed to abortion. However, there is no way to conduct the necessary research on human ova without sacrificing the lives of potential human beings. She desperately wants to conduct the research, but obviously, the sacrifice of human ova is fundamentally incompatible with her belief in the sanctity of human life. (Qtd. From Weiten, 2006)\nPart II: Please indicate the level of moral reasoning for each item below using Kohlberg’s theory. \n\n1.She should do the research. Although it’s wrong to kill, there’s a greater good that can be realized through the research.\n2.She shouldn’t do the research because people will think that she’s a hypocrite and condemn her. \n3.She should do the research because she may become rich and famous as a result. Kohlberg's theory!!! You're asking alot from a Yahoo Q&A.\nRight to lifer's have always faced this quandry. How do you justify taking the life of a living being (Doctors, nurses, patients) to save the life of an unborn? You can't!\nTherefore, she cannot do the research because it would be contradictory to her beliefs!

How many guys out there would turn down a big girl just because she is big even though she is very pretty?   I love women, I have dated big girls and small girls. Different races and different creeds. It has always come down to, not how she looks, but how she makes me feel.\nI pity the guy that limits himself to Barbies or big girls for that matter. So much of attraction is not just with the eyes. Ultimately it is how someone touches you or how they make you laugh or how easy they are to share silence with.\nTo any of you guys out there that limit themselves to a body type when seeking mates, good luck buddy.
can any one give me info on cloning?please...and not wikipedia!!?   well cloning in simple terms in duplicating the DNA of something.  Sheep have been successfully cloned.  The idea of cloning is actually quite simple.  Its the actual process that is difficult.\nwhen cloning something...lets say u want to clone yourself...u need an unfertilized egg cell (human egg cell in this case) and a DNA sample of the source (you).  First the nucleus of the egg cell needs to be removed.  Another nucleus containing your DNA is put into the egg cell.  Some kind of chemical is then added which triggers the fertilizatoin process.  The egg will begin to divide until it becomes stem cells.  If left alone they will become a fetus which will grow into a human infant--your clone.\n\nOn another note...the stem cells could be taken, and with more research, could be turned into any organ of the body that will match the donor of the DNA perfectlly.  What does this mean?  If your diabetic and need insulin shots everyday...u could use stem cells to grow a new pancreas and theoretically cure diabetes.  Virtually all diseases could be cured with stem cells, but a moral issue comes up about when life starts and u need to kill other cells to get the stem cells...so current legislation restricts stem cell research in America
Their are four errors in this sentance? What are they?? 1) Their should be there.\n2) Sentance should be sentence.\n3) The question mark should be a period.\n4) There are only three errors, hey, waitaminute!\n\nBut if there are four errors, then isn't the statement true, and therefore there are three errors, so the statement is false, and therefore there are four errors and my head explodes around here :(
Have you suffered from back pain?  What was the cause and how did it affect you and your family? I am trying to answer the question why back pain is so common.  By finding out the causes will be a great help in trying to answer this question.  I am also interested in finding out whether people really do look after their backs when going about their daily tasks and whether they think before lifting, stretching and moving etc.  Back pain also affects industry and I would like to know if your back pain was/is work related and whether it meant taking time off of work. A very high percentage of the western world's population would answer "yes" to this question.\nMostly caused by repetitive patterns of movement either at work or in a particular sport. This includes lengthy sitting at a desk. These patterns usually develop an imbalance in the body of short and weak muscles, either left/right or front/back of joints. After injury we are given rest (ant-inflammatory meds)and exercises. In time the pain usually goes. So then what do we do? Go back to work/sport, doing same old movements, no need to continue those exercises; "I feel better now".\nThen we wonder why the problem comes back some time later??\nDUH?\nI had a back history many years ago and have solved the problem by treating and managing the cause.
after the procedure how long to wait to do home test for pregnancy? after 10 days of abortion and no sex, i did home pregnancy test and it came out "pregnant" but all the other signs, like the morning sickness, hard to swallow, being ofended by small smels etc... are gone and i feel health. so how long i have to wait to do the home test or is something wrong with me? It is a difficult call because after any pregnancy - whether live birth, stillbirth, miscarriage or abortion, one still sees positive home pregnancy tests for up to eight weeks following the birth or loss. \n\nThe only way to determine if you are in fact pregnant right now would be to ask for a blood test. If your levels are up, you will be asked to return the following week to see if those initial levels have doubled. If that happens, you are pregnant. If the levels stay the same or drop, you may have been recently pregnant again or just have lingering hCG hormone in your bloodstream from your last pregnancy\nhttp://www.anairhoads.org/bc/pregabort.shtml

What schooling is required for a carreer in astronomy (or astrology)?   ASTRONOMY (science)\nAs with all sciences, you've got to know your math and physics.  If you really are interested, then you WILL need to take Trig and Calc I, II and III.  (Don't be afraid, the names are just scary.)  On a side note, it's pretty hard to get a job as an astronomer.  \n\nASTROLOGY (voodoo)\nJust read some books.

Some of these people I have found to be rather aggresive and blunt.

why did i become an accountant?   I switched my college major from Fine Art to Accounting after I saw that there was not going to be an occupation for me from the BFA.  I changed my major to accounting because I was told that was where reliable jobs could be found.\n\nI hated my classes.  I was FORCED by scheduling problems to take an elective in Computer Sciences.  \nI sat in that class and worried for two days because I couldn't for the life of me see what was hard, and figured I must be COMPLETELY MISSING IT to not know.\nBy the end of the week, I changed my major again.\n\nHad I been given a personality test, all of that could have been avoided:\nHere is a link to a Kiersey temperament sorter.  The basic test is free, and it will sort you into a type, such as INTJ, that can be associated with occupations.  They give an overview of the qualities of each type.  \n\nThis will either tell you WHY you are in accounting or tell you where you ought to go to get out.\nhttp://www.personalitytype.com/quiz.asp\nEdit: Changed link, old link no longer giving free results.

Do you think people are  loving for the most part or not tolerant? I beleive in a saying go wehre you are clelbrated not where you are tolerated.\n\nDo you find people to be loving for the most part or judgemental or intolerant of others that are not like them.\n\nI was not always tolerated and when I was accepted by people I found it very hard to deal with because I was always treated with great hostility. \n\nWhat do you think? I think it's about half and half.  Some people have a very caring nature while there are those who are full of hate that they will not tolerate anyting that does not conform to their ideas.  Keep the faith, not all of us are full of hatred.
Can I improve the mood of a young adult schizophrenic via nutrition, exercise, anti-stress, better sleep habit   Your listed elements for improvement in a schizophrenic young adult are quite ok. But you can help him even more by letting him enjoy romantic movies, melodius music, popular operas, magic shows, circus, sports, fashion shows etc. and by detailing & showing him all positive & colorful features of human life and taking him for outing in unknown places to show him the beauty of the world he is living in. This will definitely help him motivate & let him realize the very  meaning of human life & how colorful the life is! \nThe state of schizophrenia is the outcome of some kind of frustration. \nSo, treatment of frustration is the key to its success.

child abuse questions? i need to be able to interview a specialist in this area.. as in their career is working in this area of whatever it is... Ask them their opinion on child abuse.

I have found through my work, child abuse and neglect is handled different among some of the areas above.  Should it be this way?  No, but that has been my personal experience.
More Firefox users than IE? Is it just me, or it seems that everytime a question about browser is asked, most of the answerer recommends Firefox (Including me), and most of the answerer hailed firefox while booed IE, Firefox still has a very small market share overall.  The reason why you see so many recommendations here for Firefox is that many of the people who would be attracted to Firefoxes' features are the same type of people that would answer questions on computer subjects.\n\nEdit:  Microsoft has put tabbing in as a feature of IE7.\n\nEdit 2: To the original poster, that people are lazy is a suprise to you?  Of course thats why most people use IE.  There is also the fact that 80% of the people that own a computer are not capable of downloading and installing a new browser, nor do they care to.  \n\nFirefox remains a niche market, one that will not take over for IE. Until Linux comes out with a package that my mother can understand, it won't take over the home desktop.  It doesn't matter what is better, look at the Mac, the Betamax, and all the other "better" products out there that lost to an inferior product.\n\nI thought this was a question, not a debate.  If you wanted to post a question "What is the better browser?" go ahead, but you asked if there were more Firefox users than IE, and the answer is no, and will remain no for the forseeable future.
how do i start dating after being married and divorce three times? it seems no one is interested or I have something on my forehead that says no If it were me, I would focus on other things, enjoy getting to know 'my self' again, and see if fate brings someone my way.  I wouldn't go looking.  \n\nJoin a club, or take up some hobbies. Go about life differently than you have in the past.  What you were doing doesn't seem to be working, so taking a different path might be the most advisable course of action.
What can I do to keep power cable on my laptop from getting really hot? The power cable that goes to my laptop gets so hot and I don't know what to do. Cooling systemms are made for the laptops themselves but what about the cable? Please help! I would suggest getting a new cord.  Just right down the information that is on the cord (voltage and resistance and such other things) and take it to your closest computer store and tell them what you need.  I have noticed that laptop cables do get hot sometimes, but that's only on old ones that I have seen--so it is probably time to replace it, if it is old.\n\nNote:  Resistance in electrical systems generates heat energy.  So, keeping that in mind, you may want to get a cord with less ohms/resistance.
Why do people pierce their ears with those piercing that stretch the skin? I mean what is the point? What are they going to do 10,15,30yrs from now when it's not cool and out of fashion? I have stretched earlobes.  More than ten years ago, when it was far from being "in fashion", countless people told me that I'd regret it.  Well, a hell of a lot of time has passed and I love my ears more than I did when I started.\n\nAs for you wanting to know what the "point" is, for myself it has been purely ornamental.  Honestly, I would not look or feel like myself if I looked any way other than the way that I do.\n\nYour question has an antagonistic element to it, as in maybe you think poorly about people who choose to do this.  Try to be less judgmental.  There may be things about you that others would look at and question in a similar manner.

what is 3*21+1-18+20-2 squared?   4096.  Do all the multiplication first, then add and subtract, then square your answer.\n\nWhat the math teacher said is right EXCEPT he messed up on the subtraction in one step.  The process should look like this:\n\n3*21= 63\n63+1=64\n64-18= 46 (not 56)\n46+20=66\n66-2=64\n64 squared=4096

what is the need for CRM in insurance?   Despite the resistance, insurance companies are finding they must turn to new, unexplored avenues for cost reduction. \n\nThe industry has not made an underwriting profit in almost a decade. Up until recently, insurers were able to survive -- and in many cases do quite well -- because they made up losses through investment and asset management income. But 2001 proved to be a turning point. \n\nLast year was one of the most dismal underwriting years ever, and the asset management side of the insurance business began to falter due to the sinking stock market and volatility in the credit markets. \n\nMoreover, there was increased competitive pressure on insurance firms from financial services companies. \n\nInsurers are, of course, embracing all the prescribed measures for tough times, such as tighter underwriting requirements and participation in industry e-commerce endeavors. \n\nNevertheless, industry watchers and participants are witnessing a distinct movement toward CRM in the insurance sector as a novel way to beat the odds. \n\n"An insurance company is always interested in avoiding loss, whether that loss is paid out through settlements or through excessive administrative overhead," Aberdeen Group research director Denis Pombriant told CRMDaily.
What is the difference between likelihood and probability?   probability: for equally likely outcomes, the number of favourable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes of an experiment.\n\nlikelihood: Losses may be characterised by the probability or frequency with which they are likely to occur (in a particular environment). This probability or frequency is the likelihood of the loss. Likelihoods may be expressed qualitatively (on a scale from Frequent to Incredible, for example) or quantitatively (as a probability of occurrence within a specified interval, as a mean time between occurrences, or as a number of occurrences expected in a specified interval).
Where can I find my Credit Score? I've had one credit card for over a year and 3 other for about 5 months. \n\nI am trying to buy a house, and I know I need good credit to do so.\n\nI pay all my bills on time and in full.\n\nWhere can I see my credit report? \n\nAnd possibly, for free? Really bad info posted here.\n\nLets start with the basics.\n\nBy law you can get all 3 of your credit reports free at www.annualcreditreport.com once per year.\n\nNow for credit scoring, the ONLY credit score that lenders look at is a FICO credit score. Unfortunately it is not free. You can get your FICO credit score from Equifax for $7.95 but that is only one credit bureau. \n\nWhen you apply for a mortgage the lender will pull all 3 credit bureaus and "price" your loan from the middle score, so you really need to know all 3 of your FICO scores.\n\nOnce you have reviewed your credit reports for accuracy and disputed any items that you believe to be inaccurate you can go to www.myfico.com/12 and get all 3 of your FICO scores for $45.00. This will also give you the top 4 reasons as to why your credit scores aren't higher.\n\nWhen you have all 3 of your FICO credit scores you can do some rate shopping before you apply. www.bankrate.com has calculators to determine what you can afford and in the mortgage section you can see a table of potential lenders with accurate rates in your local area.\n\nAlso go to www.myfico.com and look in the Credit Education section to see how credit scores work.\n\nGood Luck

Has anyone had any experience of Xoftspy? Does it work? It's just that I followed links to remove a virus from my computer and everything led to this program, but am sceptical. It would be very easy to fake that sort of thing. Don't wanna shell out $60 for soemthing that doesn't work. Don't buy it! It sucks. If you want to buy one google "anti-spyware reviews" or something similar and and look for an unbiased rating site or blog; they tell you the good and the bad and the costs. I tried several and the best two I've used are both free downloads. One is Spybot and the other is Ad-Aware by Lavasoft. I just bought this computer Saturday and the security upgrade I bought with it has Spysweeper by Webroot. I haven't used it yet but I remember it being one of the best recommended on some of the blogs. XoftSpy and a couple of others I downloaded for a supposed free trial let you install it and scan for problems, then want you to buy it before you can remove or quarantine anything. Then you can't uninstall some of them. Be careful when using any of them; be sure you read the instructions thoroughly and just quarantine or be sure you can reverse the actions in case you accidentally delete something that is associated with a legitimate file. If you have system restore, be sure to create a SYSTEM CHECKPOINT before you run and remove stuff. I will save you a lot of headaches if something gets screwed up.
Is it me or is Kevin Federline a complete looser?   He is a looser because he's acting like he was a little bit famous before he married Britney Spears, but I think he was just a back up dancer that no one really knew or cared that much about to really know.  I think that he will say stupid things to the press and get away with it because he' Mr. Britney Spears, and no one can touch him and bring him down.

How many teeth  do children lose?   Twenty.  Baby or primary teeth are lettered A through T.  Unless there is an unusual circumstance: example some children retain baby teeth when there is not a permanant tooth under it.  Children have twenty teeth by about age three.  The permanant molars come in behind the last teeth in the child's mouth.  Central incisors, Lateral incisors, canines, and premolars (bicuspids) come in as the baby teeth fall out.  Most children have all of their permanant teeth by age thirteen or fourteen give or take.  Except wisdom teeth which can come in between the ages of 17-21.  Note not all children have wisdom teeth, some have four, some two, and so on.  In the case of my son he is missing a permanant premolar (lower left side, second one) his baby tooth will have to suffice for as long as possible or until he stops growing, then we will have an implant placed in this missing tooth area.  Adult teeth are numbered 1-32.

Boy's and girls... suggestions please!!? The guy I've been dating is really sweet. But when i went ice skating with him and some of my friends and some of his, he spent like 20 minutes with me and the session is about 2 hours long. He was around his friends and one of my friends the whole night. Then when he realized i was mad, he came over and hugged me and apoligized a million times. Then at the end he left without a good bye. Is he worth keeping? dump him

For many months I've been hacking up mostly clear slimy mucous..sometimes thick and sometimes more liquidy.. When I eat sugary products it seems to get a little worse...does anyone know how this is cured? I take predisone steroid and bronchial inhaler(when needed) and allergy pills like allegra as needed...Thanks for any help. there is no cure. Chronic Bronchitis is COPD.. COPD is a term used for obsturctive diseases. You need to see a pulmonologist.. they can get you on a regimin to help you
Is Stadium Arcadium going to be the best Red Hot Chili Peppers album?? I've only heard one song from the album, Dani California, and it's great. I seriously think they only get better every album. And being from California I have to support all the bands from here, so I could never hate on them Anyway. But I just am wondering.... Anthony Kiedis says it's the best thing they've ever done. I think it will be awesome. Dani California is becoming one of my favorite RHCP songs.

I need good advice? I have a problem. I am in love with a girl who I have dated off and on for 2 years. I really loves her but she is dating a guy named Ian. She loves Me and Ian both but she doesn't know which one to date and we hate each other guts but are nice to each other just top make her happy. She says that i am loving caring but that sometimes she feel i don't care what she is talking bout but i really do. Ian is loving and caring and he show more emotion in public and stuff but sometimes takes it too far and when me and her are alone we do some stuff but not as much in public. I told her I would change that but I don't think she believes me. I need your advise for her and me both. Who should she date? What should I do to get here to like me more? as for you, i think you should just relax for a little bit. maybe start hanging out with some new girls and just put the first girl on the backburner. this will help you in that you won't be so tied up in it all the time, and it will also help her because it will give her a chance to figure some stuff out. more importantly, she will see what she's missing if you two hang out less. this will likely make you much more attractive to her. or, worst case scenario, she'll pick ian. (which is unlikely) but if she does, then obviously the relationship wouldn't have worked anyway. moral of the story: give the relationship a little breathing room and cross your fingers. good luck!

how do i get money from paypal when i sell on ebay? i have sold a few things on ebay, and they have paid me through paypal. but how do i get the money? it's not showing up in my account. Two steps:\n\n1) You have to link your PayPal account with you bank account.\n2) Then you can transfer money from PayPal account to that account. Unlike the case when you are buying and paying money, when you receive money it is not transferred automatically - you have to do it yourself.

I'm on a soccer team, this is my first year...help? This is only my first year playing soccer and people say I'm good but I don't think I'm good enough. How can I get better? I practice two times every week and have a game on weekends. Oh yeah, I'm also defence, either right or left. The key to football is not like any sport. Sports are about using your athletic ability to complement the game in hand. In football you use your brain more, and in defence this is more so. People are saying your good, and this proves you have the sporting ability.\n\nEvery time somebody runs at you with the ball (which will happen a lot playing full back) have a think about where hes going, and when hes going to put the ball in the box. Watch the ball and the feet, and get used to thinking quickly.\n\nAnother good tip for a full back is practice coming forward. You may be a defender, but it is good to support your wingers. Overlap them when they hold the ball up and practise your crossing so they can lay you off by the byline.\n\nStay fit and healthy, because to be a good right back, your going to need to get up and down the pitch. Im not sure what level your playing on, but anothe good tip is to listen to your coach. He may not always be right, but discipline will reflect on the pitch.\n\nAlso, try simple training methods;\njuggling- control\npassing against a wall back to your feet- passing and control\nskills- if your up to it, watch and try and repeat\n\nGood luck!

how do i express the lcd within fractions?   It is the smallest (non-zero) number that is a multiple of the denominators. For instance, the LCD of {1/2, 1/4} is 4 because the least common multiple of 2 and 4 is 4. Likewise the LCD of {1/2, 1/3} is 6.\n\nBy using this (or any multiple of it) as a denominator, it enables addition, subtraction or comparison of fractions:\n\n1/2 + 1/4 = 2/4 + 1/4 = 3/4; \n1/2 − 1/3 = 3/6 − 2/6 = 1/6; \n1/3 < 2/5 since 5/15 < 6/15.
When did the French revolution started?   It is difficult to actually pinpoint a specific date when the French Revolution started. It was just a sequence of events which led to it. Among the most important dates which mark the start of French of Revolution is the "Storming of the Bastille prison" on July 14th 1789. For more dates and events check the website below:
Violated My Probation For Misdeameanors With Suspended Sentence...Going To Jail? Ok I pleaded to three counts of theft under 100 sentenced to 9 months all suspended and 2 years on probation, haven't been arrested or anything no failed drug tests I mind my own business all that good stuff all I did was not finish all of my community service hours because of my job and have letters written from my managers at my job vouching that for me and I fell back on my payments. I caught up on my payments and talked to the community service director who said she was willing to take me back into the program as long as I finished my community service hours for my driving while suspended case which I will on Wednesday. I have a hearing for the violation on Friday and I have one of the best lawyers in town am I looking at going to jail? Or will the judge just tell me to get my shit together and finish my community service? Help I'm freaking out in my head!!! Loss Leader hits another one out of the park.\n\nCome on...you've got a lawyer.  Ask him/her.  You're asking a bunch of yahoos on Yahoo a question about your future liberty, and nobody here knows thing one about you and your criminal cases.  \n\nHave I seen people in like circumstances get a little jail time as a "wake up" call?  Yes.\n\nHave I seen people in like circumstances have their probation revoked and reinstated (basically a "do-over") with or without jail time?  Yes.\n\nHave I even seen people get their butt chewed by the judge, and then sent back out the same door they came in?  Yes.\n\nKiss some serious a$$ in court (or let your "best lawyer in town" do it for you), and take your lumps.  Then be more responsible and play the game until you get off probation.  \n\nGood luck.
What kind of taxes do I have to pay if I sell things on the Internet? Let's say that I decide to sell a few possessions (books, collectibles, etc.) online.  What kind of taxes would I be responsible to pay in that situation? depends.  if they are personal property, and you didn't sell them for more than you paid, it's handled like a garage sale, no fed taxes.  can't speak for the state.  however, if you start doing this as a source of income, the answer changes.
Where can I find  Biblebased answers to specific questions? Topic: "70 times 7", Where in the Bible do I find this verse? Seventy times seven come up in Matthew 18:21-22 specifically.  But in context it is about forgiveness.  Peter asks Jesus how many times he should forgive his brother when he sins against him and Peter reasons that seven times is enough.  Jesus counters by saying "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times."  Seventy-seven may also be "seventy times seven".  \n\nThere may be other passages, but this is the only one I could find.  \n\nYou can visit www.biblegateway.com or a good Bible concordance (like Strong's Exhaustive Concordance) for more info, and I also recommend checking out a commentary.  There are some on the Bible Gateway website, and there are others at your local library and bookstore.  One of my favorite commentaries is "Thru the Bible" by J. Vernon McGee.  Awesome commentary.\n\nHope this helps!
Why do people automaticaly assume things about me when they don't know me from Adam? I wish I could elaberate on this, but I can't think of an example right off the top of my head right now. For some reason nobody gives me a changes and wants to take the time to know all the facts first. Oh! Here is an example! - This subject comes up without fail no matter what I do: I'll say to the man or woman/friend/boyfriend or whoever that I do not drive and they'll ask me why and I'll say that it's because I am vissually impaired and they'll automatically say "well why can't you just get glasses or get lazer surgery". Well, my eyesite can not be corrected like magic. I have perminant eye damage. Take it or leave it. ...Oh shoot, sorry, I'm just frustrated and am wurried that I am doomed if tha is going to be the topic with everyone I mean. I perfer not to talk about it and try not to bring it up and dodge it etc, but nothing works. Any thoughts?...There are other things that I wish I could dodge around too. Not just my eyesite. You know people do assume things about a person, when they\nfirst look at them. If they have time to get to know you\nthey will learn the real you. And you are worth getting to\nknow! I am sorry about your eye sight. I will have to have\nsurgery on my eye when a growth gets to a certain size and I am not looking forward to it. I will have faith that all\nwill be well.  I really think wading through is better than\ndodging problems. When that's done it is resolved instead of put off. The best of luck.

Is this normal ? I'm trying to lose weight right now, i want to lose 6-10 lbs that's all. So i eat only once a day, and drink a lot of water. After 3 days, i realized that i lost my apetite, i don't want to eat, i'm not hungry, but i have a bad headache. I ate something just 15 minutes ago, and i puked a bit. I puked because i felt something wrong in my stomach, i'm not bulimic. Is it normal ? Is this a sign that i'm bulimic ? Well, its not normal to puke after eating, nor is it normal to loose your appetite. \n\nEating only one meal a day is actually worse for you than eating three meals a day. the best thing you can do is eat five small meals a day...this helps maintain your metabolism, and will get you to burn offf fat more quickly. Eating only once per day starves your body - thats what is causing the headaches. Also, because your body starves, when you do finally eat soemthing - no matter how healthy - the body manufactures it into stored fat. So, youre doing the opposite of what your body wants and needs! \n\nStick with the lots of water, but add in several fruits and veges and exercise. You'll loose those pounds faster than you thought! \n\nGood luck, and remember that no matter who you are or what you think you look like, youre a beautiful person. Always.
A young boy maybe 5 or 6 asks Why is that rainbow in the sky? What does it mean? How did it get there? This little boy is a neighbor or even your son. You are late for a religious meeting or a big business deal.\n\nWhat will you say? "Go away kid you are bothering me and I am late" I will tell you later. Go ask your pop or your mom. Hey kid, that is just the way it is, OK.\n\nMaybe you will take the time and say well kid first here read this bible passage or you know son God made a big flood and put that there as a sign, and so on, etc.\n\nMaybe you will say "Son is it nice to see? The kid says "Yes"\n\nThen you say son, God put that there so right now I could hug you so you know both God and I do love you. You see God put that there so we could be together right now and talk cause you are very special to both of us. Isn"t God very good?\n\nNow in the future will that little boy not be happy to tell his friends that God put that up there cause God loves him. Won't that boy remember that hug also.\n\nNow what would a so called christian do?\n\n cjkeysjr@yahooo.com.ph Good day to ALL Wow,what an inspiring message for a beautiful morning at OKL.Now I understand what that means,God is there forever and will never leave us no matter what the circumstances are.Like that storm awhile ago in 6 states,After the tragedy,God will place a rainbow to remind us that He still loves us.

Maybe you should un-vow your life to him.  I vowed my life to Don Vito, because I dont see him getting engaged anytime soon.

Tips on Starting an Eclectic Wiccan Coven? I am moving to a new area with very few Pagan/Wiccan Gatherings, but plenty of Pagan/Wiccans.  I want some tips on how to organize people and what to do at organized meetings. Blessed Be.  My advice is if you don't already have it go by the book Coven Craft by Amber K.  It has guidlines on how to start a coven.  I myself am a member of the NROOGD tradition.  Also check out witchvox.com.  They have a community page and you may find others with the same interest in your area.
Recently girls have been saying i c_um to much or c_um huge amounts, what is normal amount? and what is alot? A few have choked when trying to swallow, most with the expression "didnt expect that much", or the occasional "it just wont stop". Every time i measure it myself, i dont seem to go as much as when im with a girl, and seems abit normal.  I did a search and 1teaspoon just doesnt seem right for normal.\n\ntrying not to brag, the last girl i was with didnt swallow instead let me go on her chest, she had DD's and i was able to cover them and abit of her stomach.  Her expression was "you didnt tell me you were mt. rushmore" don't worry, tell her to swallow as soon as you start to come
Do people actually think jesus was white? Like he might not have been black but common...the way some people depict jesus is as if he had blond hair and blue eyes...he was living in the middle east like babylon or jerusalem or something.....he would be atleast a tanned brown or egyptian tan color. Who cares if he was white or black. The important thing is you believe in his teaching.

Can anyone help with a project management software? I need a software that can help me manage the project undertaken by members of my team. It should be based on different ogin profiles so that users can login and view the extent to which team members have gone in their various assignments. The most widely available and used PM tool is MS Project.  The desktop version of the product will run around $600.  It doesn't really have different logon profiles, but you can create different Views to slice/dice the project data differently.\n\nIf you really need different profiles you could step up to MS Project Server, but this is a big step in terms of complexity and cost.\n\nBefore you invest in a tool, you might want to get your team some project management theory training, otherwise they're not going to really understand what to do with tool, even if they get some tool training.  (Just like getting training in MS Word isn't really going to improve your report writing capabilities - you'd need to take a report writing class as well.)
How can you find the heat of vaporization of water according to the experimental values given? Scenario:\n\nA beaker of 300mL of water at 64 degrees Celsius is placed into a vacuum bell.  Pressure is relieved and the substance is allowed to boil.  When the bell is removed there are 284mL of water left and the temperature is 44 degrees Celsius.\n\nProblems:\nAssuming that there was no heat lost or gained through a temperature difference of the remaining air inside the bell jar during the time of boiling and that the rate of cooling and boiling was constant,\n\n1. Explain the drastic change in temperature of the water.\n2. Calculate the heat of vaporization of the water in cal/gram according to the energy change of the water that was evaporated. I don't have a calculator handy, but I'll help where I can.\n\nEvaporation is endothermic, meaning that it takes in heat.  The amount of heat taken in when one mole of water evaporates is its molar enthalpy of vaporization.\n\nSo, first, find out how much of the water evaporated.  Assuming standard conditions, 1 mL of water weighs 1g.  So that means that 16g of water evaporated. (With me so far?)  Now use that to find out that you have a bit less than on mole of water vapor.\n\nWhere did the energy that the evaporating water use come from?  The other molecules of water.  You know that the amount of energy released when 284g of water decreases temperature is related in the formula q=mC(Tfinal-Tinitial).  (Only the other 284g of water decreased temp...the other 16g gained temp.)  Now you can figure out how much energy the water vapor absorbed when it changed into a gas.\n\nTake the energy # and divide by the # of moles... and you are set.\n\n\nOh side note: since you are dropping the pressure, you do not need to worry about heating the water up inorder to make it boil.
Which language is better/easier to learn: Japanese or Chinese?   Chinese is more difficult, but it's more helpful.  Many Asian languages including Japanese and Korean are derived from Chinese.  So if you can write Chinese, even educated Japanese and Koreans can understand you.  Don't learn simplified Chinese for 2 reasons.  1) only people in China can read it and 2) it's incredibly ugly, and disrupts the traditional calligraphy of the characters.

I am planning to take the GMAT in a few years upon completion of my law degree...help? I want an MBA to complementmy law degree. I have very little math background. I havent had it since freshman year in college...I would say that my skills are average...I like math, but dont love it.  Algebra is extremelyeasy for me while statistics is my hardest.  I m aware of basicc concepts across the math spectrum, but i need like a refresher...Would a course w/ princeton review or kaplan be enough orwould i need more help?  If i do need more help, where can i get it? Do the Kaplan. My roomate at my MBA was a law grad with very little math background. He prepared the math section for 3 months, basically going through Kaplan. He also got 3 hours with a tutor to make sure he was on track. \nGMAT questions are made to be answered in a couple of minutes, so they are not hard. You just have to apply basic math quickly... so practice is all it takes.\n\nGL.

What do you think? My bf....? He told me that one of the reasons he did not pursue the marriage he promised me is because of my weight. He said that if I would try to lose weight, then maybe he would be more into marrying me. I knew then he did not really love me. What do you think? Oh, honey. Run away from this man. He needs to love you and respect you for YOU and not what you look like on the outside. It seriously sounds like this man has control/domineering issues and you'll only get screwed up by staying with him.\nListen, I know it's hard to be alone- you're harder on yourself when you feel that you're all by yourself, right? But the torture you'll put yourself through by staying with a mentally abusive man is FAR worse. Learn to believe in yourself-- lots of good things will follow, you just need to get to know 'you' first!  ;)
interesting question catch22 how fair and sane is this? heres the story... recently it turns out i need a state issued id.  with out one i cannot open a bank account, get a phone, go to school, or drink<--- AHHHHHHHH.  basicly im a 3rd class citizen.  however i have been in the military not once but twice... i still have the id from the army. but this id and my old licence both happen to be expired but still have the holigrams and are obviously not fake.  however i couldnt just walk into the registry and get a new id with either of those forms of id.  they sent me to the social security office.  there they told me i couldnt get a ss card without a state issued id.  i dont have a copy of my birth certificate or but ive lived in this country all my life.  what the hell is this about. ...? The stupid idea of "You can't get an ID without an ID". Try to explain this to them and ask THEM for their opinion on your situation. Most of the time they are helpful and will point you to the right direction.\n\nI had a similar situation with my husband. He had an old expired ID from another country and that country's consulate wouldn't give him an ID, the DMV wouldn't give him an ID. SO, we just asked the DMV what we should do? They suggested official school records, you request them and keep them sealed and let the DMV open them. They just want to make sure it's you. Hope that helps!

what should I know for a market research position as an economics major? I studied finance too, and have worked as an account executive. 1. Hone your math skills as you will be doing a lot of t-tests and such. Learn as much as you can about statistics.\n2. Learn more about marketing, of course.\n3. Study effective data presentation. It's one thing to make a table but another to make a table that will convey a marketing story for the customer.\n4. Learn how to write well. You will be writing lots of reports.
does he have the right to be mad? i am separated from my husband even though we still talk on the phone-we have kids together-we were married for 18 years.\n\nMy boyfriend of 13 months is pissed because when i was talking to my husband on the phone he said "i love you" when we were hanging up. i said "i know"-----it is very OVER between my husband and me. i love my bf only want him.  my husband was abusive. my boyfriend says i should have said you dont love me too much or you wouldnt drag me around by the hair,hit me,etc. etc.  \nwhere did i go wrong    or am i wrong?\n\nMy boyfriend is sure he is 100% right.  I feel im 100% right.  we are at the point of breaking up. my bf says how can you tell him you KNOW he loves you when you tell me you dont know if i love you.   He told me to write everyone for advice. can anyone help???????? Don't be talking to your ex hubby.  You may not think he can get to you that you are happy, but they have a way of getting to you.  I know because I have been there and I am now remarried to my ex because I let him back in, I regret it deeply.  So my advice the less you talk just as friends the better off.  He didn't change until you were happy and with some one else am I right.

In addition to what I have learned.....? ive also learned that we live in a corrupt society where in most, not all relationships, that regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first, the passion fades, and there had better be a lot of money to take its place. Wouldnt you agree? No, I think true love changes over time.. not fades.  Research has actually shown that if we were to stay in that passionate state that happens at the beginning of a relationship for an extended period of time it would be bad for our health.  It is actually a good thing that it grows and matures.

What exactly is Intelligent Design and where can I find literature on it?   Intelligent Design is the theory that life did not evolve in the manner stated in Darwin's Theory of Evolution (which is an undirected process), but rather that a "Supreme Being" (who is never identified by a specific name but often believed to be the God of the Christian faith) deliberately guided their creation.  The theory rests on the premise that there are some life forms (such as humans) that are too complex to have been formed through the directionless process of evolution.

how do i find out why my friend got arrested in oregon state?   If you know the town or city, and date of arrest, you can check the local newspaper on-line for the police blotter. If it was a more serious crime, you can check for local TV news stations and see they say anything about it.\n\nAlso, if you know if it was city, or county police that arrested him, you can sometimes call them and explain that you are a friend from out-of-state, and that he has asked you for help, but you want to be sure he isn't lying to you about the charge. Since it's public record, they may offer to tell you over the phone.
i have dsl connection, but lately my websurfing and downloading is very slow. why? I have tried defrag, spyware and adware removal programs (spybot, Ad-Aware) and i have deleted temporary internet files etc. I have also run my McAfee virus protection. maybe your isp is having problems, maybe you should contact them.  or, if you're on a contract and you have limited downloads, you might have used your monthly limit, and your speed has been dropped down.

How does the Budget report differ from the Cash Flow report? project management Actually, you can create a pro-forma "budget" or "cashflow". A budget simply means a schedule of costs, it does not necessarily mean "cash". Cashflow is specific - it only deals with cash expenses, for example you would have a depreciation schedule (non-cash) on budget, but not on cashflow. You might have pre-paid expenses on your budget but not on your cashflow. A budget tells you when things happen, either cash or accrual. Cashflow is only about cash, literally.

Which balanced fund was ranked number one by Lipper Inc. in 2005?   Here are the top 20, the first % is the actual gain.

We are all just a bunch of Dr. Phills' who hand out prescriptionscalled "Here's my Opinion". Take two a day and your problems will fade away! Or we ask a question to a bunch of people with the same problem who don't know how to solve their own issues!

I have a question about Third Party Candidates in US Presidential Elections? Why is it in Presidental Elections, third party candidates are usually the same candidate from the previous election giving the same speeches about what they are going to do for America, and why are they confident that they are going to be the President of the United States? Lame.  They need to run for House or Senate.  That way, a step has been taken.  For them to assume that the United States population will vote for a third party Commander in Chief is lame.

Regarding Yoga: Any inofmation on the Plough position? I HAVE BEGUN A YOGA SCHEDUAL, ON MY OWN, AS I AM A STUDENT AND CANNOT PAY FOR A TRAINER, BUT I AM MOVING ALONG QUITE NICELY. ALTHOUGH, I DO RUN INOT DIFFICULTIES WHEN I COMPLETE MY TRANSITION INTO THE FULL *PLOUGH*. AFTER I RELEASE THE POSE, I FIND MYSELF WITH A TERRILE HEADACHE FOR THE NEXT 2 DAYS. THIS HAS HAPPENED FREQUENTLY. ANYONE HAVE ANY IDEAS? This is not a good sign. Something is wrong for sure, but from your description I cannot tell what it is. I'd strongly recommend you to do either of the below:\n1. Find a good teacher and show him/ her how you do the pose for diagnosis\n2. If you cannot afford #1, stop doing the pose\n\n#1 is preferred to #2 if you can afford.\n\nIf you intend to continue learning on your own, remember this: Despite all the potential benefits of yoga, it can also do harm if not careful.

how do i believe in myself? i want to do something that everyone around me doubt. If you don't believe in yourself, how can anyone else believe in you.  If you don't have the support of those around you who don't believe it you, then you have to find it in yourself and realize you want something so bad that you will achieve it.  As hard as the road can be, if you don't keep trying, you are just going to prove all those other people that they were right.  Set your mind to it and try and your chances of achieving what you want will be pretty high!\n\nI'll beleive in you!
MEN ONLY!  What if you bled every month for 5-7 days?  See, us women deserve a trophy right? I mean come one, surely you are sick of the PMS excuse but really, we can't help it.  I mean I am a completely rational person, but during that time, I cry for no reason and may be more grumpy and iriatable than usual (ok, maybe a lot more) but wouldn't you be too if your boobs hurt, you were hungry for salty food then sweet, your jeans didn't fit, and you were worried about the 5 or so pounds you gained?  Imagine this every month....what would you do?  Any advice for us ladies? there's a way to cure this.  everytime you ovulate you should call us guys to fertilize the egg or else it'll all go to waste. you can collect a trophy from us each time.

does the New York State budget law requires a balance budget, and Wy?   What is meant by a balanced budget is subject to interpretation and handled differently in many states. See this chart from the National Conference of State Legislatures (which is an organization that serves state legislators across the country and compares how issues are handled differently by different states).\n\nhttp://www.ncsl.org/programs/fiscal/balbuda.htm\n\nNew York state's requirements are considered not stringent, the Governor is required to prepare a balanced budget but the legislature is not required to pass a balanced budget, and the State is permitted to carry an operating deficit across a fiscal year boundary. \n\nAlso note, even in states with more stringent requirements it is often unclear how a balanced budget amendment can really be enforced. And New York state politicians have been notorious for the last decade or so for passing budgets later than the deadline the state is supposed to meet.
What are seniors looking for in independent and assisted living facilities? We are conducting research for a potential new independent/assisted living facility for seniors and would like to know what amenities and services residents of this type of facility would like.  Seniors only please! I'm not a senior, but I helped my mother find a place. We went looking because we wanted a place where they would check on my mother every day to make sure she is okay. One thing she wanted is a nice entrance with the feel of a nice hotel. She rejected any place that was small and crowded when you walked in. She liked the places with a concierge desk and marble floors when you came in. She wanted a decent size 2 bedroom 2 bath apt so she could have family sleep over. The food was very important. We rejected a place that only had hot breakfast three days a week and tested the food every place we went. She wanted a selection of food at every meal. She wanted lots of staff to help her by parking her car and bringing in her groceries. I wanted a place with a van service for when she had to stop driving and a pool and exercise facilities, although she has not used them. We also looked at the activities. She liked bingo and movies-they have something every night. A lot of her friends liked the bridge and poker games. She liked that they have a nursing facility on the grounds so she can stay there. She liked the attractive dining room like a nice restaurant with a view of the intercoastal. I suggest that you look at where she ended up which is Harbour's Edge in Delray. It has no trouble filling up although it is very high end. I am almost 58 years old and I would like a place like Harbour's Edge in 20 years. By the way, her friends have come to dinner there and have been so impressed that some of them have also purchased units there.
Why should I use Windows instead instead of Mac OS? What are the benefits and advantages of using Windows? I use to be a Macintosh computer technician.  I really liked macs, they are easy to use.  They also are great computers to use for graphics.  BUT, I own a windows computer.  The cost of a mac is to much.  Windows computers are cheaper.  More software is available for the windows platform.  \nCost is the major reason that I picked windows.  As a technician, when people asked me which computer to buy, I told them to find the software that you like and buy the computer that will run that software.  Some software is only available on one operating system.  If both computers run the software that you like, then look in your pocketbook.  In my opinion, windows or mac os, one operating system is not better than the other.  They both have there strong and weak points.  Windows has more viruses than macs, but that is what virus programs (notice the s in programs) are for.  If you are practice safe internet searching, don't open unfamiliar emails, be careful were you go on the web, you should have a good experience.\nEmulators are great on the mac, but they do not run ALL windows software.\n\nI would prefer a mac, but I am not rich.  If I had a choice between mac os or windows os, say they were the same price, I would chose a mac.  The reality is, windows works great!

Fun games to play in bed?  Any suggestions? Looking to surprise my boyfriend with some games tonight. Got any suggestions? The kids will be gone for the night! YES!! Think up a game that will result in something you've wanted to do but been afraid to ask for directly. Bets are great. For instance, I used to date a woman who had a bit of a submissive streak that I was unaware of. We made a bet that she could touch the bedroom doorknob and no holds barred. If I could stop her, I "owned" her until morning. Well, I won; and as it turns out, so did she... The wrestling match was hot and the results hotter!

what are scabies? i have a friend who just called and saud she has them...should i let her over my house?   OK, this is kind of gross.

You may want to see your doctor if you start itching, though.
I am 14 years old...i have been golfing for four years...what should i be scoring? only answer if you no golf please.  i am talking about like on a standard par 36 coarse. Don't worry about your total score, especially while playing.  You should just focus on each shot one at a time and at the end of the round, add em up and see what you got.\n\nThe important thing is to have fun and enjoy the game.\n\nThe one advice I can give you is to allocate at least 50% of your practice time to your short game.  Specifically, 100 yards in.  This is were you will shave off the most stokes.  Improve your short game now, so that when your body matures and your start hitting the ball farther, your scores will begin to improve dramatically.\n\nI would also recommend reading "Golf is not a game of perfect" by Dr. Bob Rotella.  This is an awesome book that talks about the psychology of the game and course management.\n\nIf you practice smartly now, it will pay big dividends down the road.\n\nBy the way, I am currently 37 and carry 0.2 USGA handicap index.  I started playing when I was 12 and when I was 14, I was playing bogie golf (shooting 45ish for 9 holes and 90ish for 18).  I used the practice strategy I mentioned above and when I was approximately 16 or 17, I went from driving the ball from around 240 yards up to 300 yards.  During that same time frame, my score dropped from the mid 80s down to the low 70s.  This literally happened over the course of a couple months.  I went on to play high school  and college golf.\n\nAnyway, just have fun, keep a good attitude and enjoy the outdoors.  Best of luck,

Is this a reasonable policy for the USA regarding the problems of foreign nations. and globalization? why don't they just withdraw all soldiers ? close their borders..and stop caring about europe or asia south america middle east etc..stop giving them money..stop trying to help every time some other country asks for it...like 1990 Kuwait...1940's Europe.... etc....it seems like a waste..let them solve their own problems...we seem to get invloved and all it does is make a bigger mess..if these other countries just magically disappeared one day would it change much?  Globalization is stupid and all it does is cause problems... your avatar is cute!!! huh? what now about peguin nations. and globaltrottersization?! (lol)
Who in your opinion is Man Utd's dead cert to be signed in the summer? There is alot of speculation out there, and i'm very interested in what other fans have to say on the summer transfer speculation and not the tabloids for a change. \n\nThere's strong rumour of Mattieu Bodmer from Lille and a slight possiblilty of Michael Ballack and Mahamadou Diarra to name a few. Seems like Chelsea will snap up most of our scouted players, stealing them beneath united's feet. Also there is Real Madrid rumoured to do their usual pre - season snap up of gunning every top player in the world and have bid for Liverpool's Steven Gerard. \n\nIn my opinion, some big names are going to be shipped between teams this summer. It's also my opinion that United need a HUGE name to sign with them to give the team a boost to carry them through next season if they are to keep up with Chelsea's pace and Arsenal's european conquistadors. \n\nOpinions please! Rooney was saying how much he admires Riquelme and wants him to come to OT. Plus Fergie has been to watch him play, Villereal are rumoured to be OK to release him and Riquelme has said that he admires United's players - so I think he will come. He will be a great creative playmaking addition, but United still need a defensive midfielder, so they might go for Duscher. I think Diarra is off the list now though thanks to their greedy owner saying he will be more expensive than (the overpriced) Essien. Essien cost 24 million - I don't think United can pay that much.

Most of the animation Companies Wanting Experienced guy in 3d MAX  what will do freshers for earning in 3d Max   i'm not exactly sure what your question is, but i think it means if you're new to 3d how do you get a job when companies only ask for people with experience. well the best way is to just get your demo reel looking awesome. put heaps of errort into it. then i would honestly just approach companies. most companies do not advertise for Junior positions. just knock on their door, get them to look at your demo reel. even if they are not hiring right there and then they will keep your demo reel on file if its good. if they dont have any work they may tell you how you can improve your demo reel, they may also know of another place that is hiring juniors.\n\nso by best piece of advise is work on ya demo reel and then just show up on the door step of the companies you want to work for. BE PREPAIRED do some research on the company before you go there. like what they recenetly finished, what they are working on right now. these can be found on the company's website\n\nhope this helps\n\neagle4

Did anyone here hear about the massive anti-war protest in New York today? It was huge.  I watched people march down Broadway for an hour and there was still no end in sight to all the protesters.  I want to know if the mainstream news covered it. There were actually 2 marches today. One for the Anti-War in Iraq. That is on Fox 5 news Ny. Then there was another demonstration to get the world to notice the situation that is occuring in uganda. You should check that one out. The participants are actually sleeping in somewhere on cement floors to draw attention to whats happening to children out there.
I want some honest opinions from someone who has dated through the online dating websites. Is it reliable ?   i think its a good way to really get to know someone before you meet them in person. meeting potential dates in 'conventional' ways (bars/clubs etc)can sometimes be awkward - not being able to chat properly etc. internet dating gives you an easy way out aswell if you find you dont get on with that particular person! it also gives you a chance to meet people that you wouldnt normally meet. i have used dating sites myself for the first time this year & have made some great new friends, been on a couple of dates and have recently started seeing a guy i get on really well with. obviously you have to be careful of the many (!) strange people on the net, but there are loads of genuine, lovely people out there too. i even convinced a couple of my friends to give internet dating a go aswell, one is also now very happy with a new man! i say go for it, you have nothing to lose & at the very least only new friends to gain!! :D

Can someone explain what email was like when it was first created? When was it?   If i could imagine, i would say like the drums in Africa as they beat the drums that could be heard from village to village each village taking it farther and farther to its destination..sometimes the enemy would hear it,(hackers). progress called computers have the same problems (hackers) life repeats itself, is we only really looked in a place called the third eye, or vision, for there is nothing new  under the sun....most times we dont catch on till we are nearing what we call the end of life....which could start in our 50's unless remain a fool all of our life
what are some similarites between the pope and the dalai lama?   I know a difference. His Holiness the Dalai Lama is the leader of only one sect of Buddhism, while the Pope is the leader of the whole Catholic Church. The Dalai Lama is the most famous Lama because He was made the leader of Tibet after they were forced to flee to India during the Chinese Invasion. They both work for peace and tolerance and encourage peaceful demonstration over armed conflict whenever possible.

WHo is Dorothea Dix? activist Visit link below:
If youre a foreing person and studied Law in your country..would u find a good job in the US? or is your degree useless? Will you end up waiting on tables? As far as practicing law in the US, you would need to pass the bar exam in the jurisdiction where you wanted to practice.  The qualifications to sit the bar vary from state to state so you'd need to contact the State Bar where you wanted to practice.\n\nThere's another alternative that might be of interest, especially if your are of expertise is in business law.  Many American corporations have subsidiaries or production facilities in foreign countries.  They need to ensure that they don't violate local laws and their American staff attorneys are pretty useless for this.  You could be valuable to them if they have facilities in your native country, particularly if you have strong English skills.

Why do most AMERICANS choose NOT to VOTE and then turn around and complain about how dump the president is? The moral of the story: If you don't VOTE, the US will have another DUMB president !!! You think that your vote means something..  The elections are very subtly fixed by popularity votes and dumping money into programs that affect the popularity of one candidate over another.  It is a fantasy to think that you have very much control over who governs you.  The political system knows its limits and is very controlled.  They want the people half way peaceful and working.  You either vote democrat or republican, anything else is throwing away your vote.  What if you don't like either??  There are no options.\nMany said because people are lazy, but I believe that folks in general have completely lost faith that they have any say in the Govt.  Their votes don't matter any more.

Should we establish a minimum IQ requirement to vote? Or, should we administer a lithimus test to assure those involved in selecting our next leaders have at least a modicum of knowledge about critical issues and the people which they are about to decide between.\n\nI know I will get the name calling mainly from those that I  refer to here.  That in itself however, will just serve to make my point abundantly clear\n\nI only bring this up because of the profusion of answers I have read on here from people who clearly had no idea about even the subjects they chose to querey us on.  You know the ones, expressed in a form which you must decipher to understand.\n\nIn addition to not pocessing the ability to spell or structure a simple sentence coherently, I also refer to those lacking any significant understanding regarding every topic they pose or respond to.\n\nRemember folks, these people cancel out even the most knowledgeable voter who has spent numerous hours investing in becoming informed so as to make an educated decision. The problem of an I.Q. test for voter-registration (aside from the obvious ones of expense, data-storage and retrieval, and the possibility of false results) is that of "I.Q." to begin with; the entire concept of a standardized test for "intelligence" has been in question, since the late , great Professor Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard, addressed some of the abuses I.Q. tests had been put to in his, "The Measurement of Man." Further more even if we accept the idea that intelligence is a measurable quality, which test should we use? The old Stanford-Binet test?  The slightly more contemporary (1976) WISC-III test? or the newer, informal on-line test-yourself variety? And who would determine which test and the cut-off point for eligible voters?\nFinally, why should we suppose that intelligence whether culturally-constructed or genetically derived would necessarily make a person choose the best candidate?  Many "intelligent" people voter for Hitler, others (such as Jean Paul Sarte) supported Stalin, long after his crimes had been revealed.  (Not to mention the 60,000,000 Americans who voted for George Bush in the last election, despite all the evidence about Iraq, the clear indications of his inability to handle the economy, and the fact that he can barely speak his native language - are all 60,000,000 of them idiots? although it might be nice to think so, it simply is not so.) Why should we think that intellectual ability equals what Plato called right opinion?\nRather than waste time and money trying to restrict the franchise (only about 50% of eligible voters exercise their franchise anyway,) why not use your own clear intelligence to help educate the electorate - not just on issues of the day, but on how to approach and analyze any issue.  I will only add that I write the above as an individual who has voted carefully in every election since I was 18, a holder of a professor's chair at a major international university, and as someone who tests out at 139 on the Stanford-Binet tests (shows you how old I am.)

How will a personal injury settlement effect my SSI benifits?   Your personal injury settlement can affect your SSI benefit (and medicaid liens) in very significant ways.  Before the settlement is finalized, you and your personal injury attorney must speak to an elder law attorney to learn how to protect the money from the government.\n\nThere are many options open to you but the moment you receive a cash settlement made directly to you, those options will shrink drastically.  Get an elderlaw attorney as soon as possible.
WHY do Most people do not beleive in GOD? china,japan,etc.? BUDDAH is very popular. Buddha's popularity isn't surprising; according to all the stories, he had everything figured out, which is exactly what everybody wants.  \n\nAs for god, most people don't believe in Santa Claus either and he's just god for little kids, or maybe just for grownups who wish they were kids.  Most Asians think that the ancestors who made it possible for us to be here are deserving of respect and regular acknowledgment; that's why they practice what westerners call ancestor-worship.  Since they have that, they don't need god.\n\nSo there you go.

When people talk about racism why do they say blacks and whites? These two statements sum up my issue:\n(1) Whites are racist\n(2) Young blacks are killing themselves through the gangster culture.\n\nThese two statements imply ALL whites are racist and ALL young blacks are involves in gangs.  Neither of which are even close to the truth.  I myself am careful not to sterotype like this.  Do you think people that say these thinks really mean "all whites" or "all blacks" or are they doing it unconciously?\n\nDoes this bother anyone else? I think all humans are by nature 'racist'.\nWe all have a need to organise, catergorize something, especially another race. There are so many different types of individuals, so many different personalities and people, most of us need something like a word, a description to describe the 'typical' characteristics (that might perhaps stem out of cultural biasness or differences in culture and hence the stereotyping), or we wouldn't be able to actually 'understand' the people.\nAdding to that, mass media tends to pull jokes that many times border on racial stereotypes, the smiling chinaman, the flirtatious Indian, the poor mexican, the nodding Japanese - it's become so widespread and mainstream that it's become an unconscious gesture of just describing or poking fun at a race.\nIt doesn't bother me so long as the jokes or the meaning isn't meant to have a vicious undertone, used to discriminate, insult or degrade the race.\nSometimes, we have to learn and accept that we all make snap and permanent judgements on people, including races. What matters is the line we draw at these judgements, jokes and so on.\n\nJenova\n(d.yuffie@gmail.com)
A website where i can get a free online book on pipeline engineering? A website on free online book on pipeline engineering? Most of the sites I have seen requires the book on pipeline engineering to be bought Send your resume to your future employer of choice, make a promise to give them first choice to hire, and ask them if they will buy your book and if they have any work-study program that gives you employment during summer and/or vacations.\n\nBasically, I think you are dreaming about getting some book like this for free without some exchange of value.\n\nLearn to use the library better, and they can also get a loan of rare books from other libraries (don't lose them!!!) or may consider your recommendation for references, especially if endorsed by faculty and other students.

Why is it that people are so afaraid to face and know their own self, and take resposiblity of their actions?   Because in these days, society has decided that nobody is responsible for their own actions.  Drank yourself into a stupor, then had a car accident?  Blame the bar where you chose to keep drinking even though you knew you had to drive.  Got caught stealing?  That's because prices are so high, and seeing others having something you do not have is "emotionally damaging".  Man broke into a house and raped a woman?  Well, what was she doing, being naked in her shower?  It seems that no matter what someone does, there is some lawyer or doctor there to make excuses and "explain why it's not their own fault".

Should I try and save my relationship? I love my boyfriend, but it seems like that past month we go either from one fight to the next or from one major drama to the next.  I spent two hours today crying and now he won't answer my calls or text messages.  Should I hold on or walk away. I would look at the fact that he might be under some stress my boyfriend and i just went through that and i finally sat him down and told him that i was tired of fighting and if this was how we were going to live that i would leave. Needless to say our relationship is back on track, but you need to establish communication that is the back bone of a good relationship. I can talk to my man about anything we are friends and lovers.  You also have to be true to your heart at the same time. I know the answer sometimes doesnt match your heart but sometimes a little pain reminds us that we arent perfect. dont stop loving though you can miss the best things if you dont let people in.

Why are questions closed for new answers? I am just asking because I really need to answer the question concerning the Camelia International scam.  People beware! This is a scam.  I, unfortunately, am the victim of such.  I recieved a check in the mail for $4,500.00.  I, like many others out there am not a total skeptic and though I thought it weird, I deposited the check into my account.  After the 5 day waiting period the check was returned to my bank as counterfeit.  When I tried to reach my initial contact, MICHEAL PETERSON, and advise him of the status of the "First Donation", his reply was that he was terminating me and that they have stopped the check.  "Stopped the check?" Like he had a choice.  Someone needs to stop him and his "company" from forwarding falsified documents.  Someone needs to warn others not to fall for "fast cash", "work from home", "your time for money" schemes that are thrown to us on a daily basis.  I guess that I am that someone.  Fool me once...Shame on you, Fool me twice...Shame on Me. Thank you for sharing. That was very nice of you. I m sorry that you were being scammed though. Good luck next time. Don't give up! Mistakes do happen on the way to success.

Excel formuals not visible in formula bar but sheet is not protected & hidden is not enabled.  What's causing? An associate is having this problem in excel where the sheet is not displaying the contents of the cell in the formula bar but the sheet is not protected and the hidden is not chosen.  He rebooted and it cleared up the situation but we're wondering what could have caused this in the first place. If rebooting cleared up the problem, it was probably a bug in the C++ code that got the methods mixed up. It was hiding the contents without checking the state of the protection.

What are examples of how physiological evidence supports evolution?   The presence of useless leg bones in certain snakes, the presence of degenerated hip bones in whales, the close physiological and anatomical similarities in organisms that are also closely related genetically.

All of these things indicate that the animals came from different animals which had different physiologies.

how should i break up with my girlfriend? my girlfriend seems like she doesn't really like me anymore. and i dont know how to approach her about it. Tell her how you feel and see what she has to say.

If you don't want to talk to her about it, just be up front and honest. Either way you will get a response from her.

Does HE speak to you? well...people at my chuch say that GOD speaks to them, but not to me, i feel like out of place. does HE speak to you, what does he say and how does he speak to you?the pastor says im goind to be a reverand, but i think not, i dont clasify myself as a "good" person, why would he say that? im kinda confused. HE actually spoke to me twice.  \n\nThe first time:\n\nMy friend Jen and I are talking about God and I'm like, "Yeah, I pray, but I never get the impression that God is listening or anything.  It just doesn't seem real to me."  So Jen tells me I just need to ask Him to reveal Himself to me and He surely will.  I'm like, yeah, right, whatever.  That night I remembered to pray that, you know, that He would reveal Himself to me.  That night as I'm sleeping, I have a dream of the most powerful, the most graceful yet commanding voice, saying, "I AM LISTENING!"\n\nThe second time:\n\nI'm driving with my friend Doug cross-country--we're going to rescue his ex-girlfriend from Champagne, IL. I puked Big Macs all over the back of the van.  We had a nasty time cleaning it all up and afterward I am completely exhausted riding in the passenger seat, just completely limp like a fish.  We are then driving down the road when lights flash behind us, sure enough, the state patrol.  My friend gets completely paranoid for some reason, and that's when I hear a whispering voice telling me, "It's just going to be a warning."  I say to my friend out loud (not bothering to explain what's happening) "It's just going to be a warning".  They end up making fun of me and he gets off with a warning.\n\nI am not sure of the trip your pastor is laying on you.  It doesn't matter if you're a "good" person... that's what grace is all about.  It's just that Jesus said specifically, do not be called 'father', for you have One Father, and He is in heaven.  Why don't you ask Him yourself?

yawning occurs due to excess co2 in body but why is it contagious?and why does it induces sleep?   Causes of yawning\nAn indication of tiredness, stress, over-work or boredom. \nAn action indicating psychological decompression after a state of high alert. \nA means of expressing powerful emotions like anger, rejection or apathy. \nA sign that one is not breathing deeply, and not receiving enough oxygen through the body. \nA yawn can express strong anti-social messages, and so in some cultures people try to mute or mask them by placing a concealing hand over the yawning mouth.\n\n \n\nA long-standing hypothesis is that yawning is caused by an excess of carbon dioxide and lack of oxygen in the blood. The brain stem detects this and triggers the yawn reflex. The mouth stretches wide and the lungs inhale deeply, bringing oxygen into the lungs and hence to the bloodstream. It is almost certain however, that this hypothesis is not correct. One study documented that this effect does not exist ("Yawning" by Robert R. Provine, pages 532-539, American Scientist, November-December 2005, Vol 93, No. 6). [1]. A more recent hypothesis is that yawning is used for regulation of body temperature. Another hypothesis is that yawns are caused by the same chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain that affect emotions, mood, appetite and other phenomena. These chemicals include serotonin, dopamine, glutamic acid and nitric oxide. As more of these compounds are activated in the brain, the frequency of yawning increases. Conversely, a greater presence in the brain of opiate neurotransmitters such as endorphins, reduces the frequency of yawning. Patients taking the serotonin reuptake inhibitor Paxil (Paroxetine HCl) have been observed yawning abnormally often.\n\nAnother theory is that yawning is similar to stretching. Yawning, like stretching, increases blood pressure and heart rate while also flexing many muscles and joints. Some have observed that if you try to stifle or prevent a yawn by clenching your jaws shut, the yawn is unsatisfying. As such, the stretching of jaw and face muscles seems to be necessary for a good yawn.\n\n \nA cockatiel yawningThe yawn reflex is often described as contagious: if one person yawns, this will cause another person to "sympathetically" yawn.[2] The reasons for this are unclear; however, recent research suggests that yawning might be a herd instinct.[3] Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood behavior among gregarious animals, similar to the howling of the wolf pack during a full moon. It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods of activity. It can serve as a warning in displaying large, canine teeth, thus proclaiming, "don't attack while I am sleeping..." The contagion of yawning is interspecific (i.e., try yawning in front of your dog). Ironically, yawning in public is generally regarded as impolite in the West, but came into fashion in polite French society for a brief period in the late 18th century. Oddly, sometimes sympathetic yawning may be caused by simply looking at a picture of a person or animal yawning, or even seeing the word "yawn".\n\nAdelie Penguins employ yawning as part of their courtship ritual. Penguin couples face off and the males engage in what is described as an "ecstatic display," their beaks open wide and their faces pointed skyward.
what is the significance of the chemical reactions during cooking?   Many recipes are actually chemical reactions. For example, if you use baking soda in muffin batter, then cook it, you are using the oven's heat to speed the production of carbon dioxide that results from mixing the sodium bicrbonate with water. This produces CO2 gas which makes bubbles that causes the batter to rise.\n\nWhen you marinate meat in a vinegar or wine sauce, the acids in the marinade break down the protein strands in the meat making the meat more tender. \n\nKneading bread dough encourages the development of gluten, which is  made up of chains of proteins. This gives bread elasticity when it is cooked.\n\nCooking is all about chemistry.

Has anyone been reading about the worlds strongest glue? Well, I'm trying to find out what type of heat this glue can withstand.  Meaning, if this product becomes availiable, will I be able to use it on car engines that reach 500 degrees Fahrenheit? The research has just begun actually, I remember it said something about sticking to anything wet or dry, but it didn't mention heat yet. I guess that's because its a natural occurring substance that is not usually subject to that kind of temp. That is a good point though, and you should be able to find out in the future. But if you told me you glued my car back together i think i might be a little skeptical!

whats the average size of a melon and do they make you sweat funny?   Well let's see.... raising melons can be a difficult and rewarding job. the standard size of a canteloupe with the proper care could be the size of a NBA regulation basketball that is if you really care for your melon. You see the canteloupe is one of the shyest melons because it has a lot to live up to being the one of the more common ones. I have found that if you spend several hours telling the melon that it is big enough and strong enoung and gosh darn it people like it, it does rather well. Now musk and honeydew are a little trickier. The tactic that has yielded the largest size in these varieties for me has been to play them against each other. I plant little seeds of jealousy like telling the honeydew that "You know why Aunt Betty always used musk melon in her 4th of July salads dont you? Its because it was bigger than you honey, its not that it tastes better its just that you havent given it your all." With the musk usually a comment about its name works, something like, "Come on lets get real, just listen to your name, musk. If you had to choose between a melon named musk or honey which one would you choose?.....honey of course. I conotates a more delicious experience in every way. The only way you'll ever get picked is if you dazzle them with your size so get busy and get big" Using this stratagey has yielded melons the size of a bowling ball. Who else loves to watch pro-bowling isnt it amazing to watch? Theres just something about those people gently scooping up those shining beauties wiping them down with the same wrag that they use on thier own sweat as the precurser to the big show, that shiny spinning beautiful warrior gracefully on its journey to meet its battle with the 10 evil white advancing monguls. Before you know it *BLAM-O* the battle is over and we see just how well our little warrior did. Ahhh, oops... I guess I got a little off track, sorry. Anyways,... as far as the sweating part it all depends on where your melon farm is located. I have had many farms in many locales. Raising melons in the heat of the Saharah can make one lose a little moisture on the brow but nothing like the Venus Vines farm I had in the 70's, I can remember bursting into flames on a few occasions. MMMM MMMM MMMM MMM MMM Toasty! Those are all problems that I solved with gallons of gatoraid mixed with pickle juice and a hat with a little teany tiny fan that I bought off and info-mercial for 5 easy payments of $19.95. Plus working in the nude helps from time to time, just remember to where your sun screen. Hope this helped. J

Defragging my computer? My computer wont defrag. It goes into "check drive for errors" then after 5 minutes I get a window that says it has tried to defrag 10 times but the windows system is busy. How do I change this situation? I successfully defragged the computer when I first got it but it suddenly starting doing this. I'm lost and its been a long time since it was last defragged. Please help. I'm not real bright with computers so any help needs to be at the novice level. Thanks. I am thinking you are a win 98 user, if you reboot into safe mode, then defrag, then it will run just fine.

what causes shortages and how can this be remedied?   Shortages happen when supply cannot keep up with demand.  In the short run, if the firm can do so, it has to bump up production.  In the mean time, the price should increase to try and lower demand a little.\n\nIn the long run, if the firm still things there will be a shortage and they're making money on the product and it has the money, then it will expand to get larger production capacity.\n\nBasically,\n-increase supply, if possible\n-increase price

Is questioning the Iraq offensive tantamount to treason? All this talk about "troops fighting to protect freedom" doesn't really wash given the sycophantic loyalism that many people appear to have to the government regime's strategies.\n\nAre americans so brain-washed that they are self-censoring? It is, in my opinion, the true patriotic duty of every American to question our leaders, voice our objections, and hold our elected representatives accountable. To do none of these things is treason against our country.

Do you think the world would be a better place if women are in charge? (Presidents of their respective countries) Yup.  Women are strong and beautiful at the same time.  That's why they always name things like ships, cars, & land after women's names.  We are better listeners, better communicators, take more time to think things through, and pay attention to detail.\n\nBut we know how to fight when needed.  So watch out; they name hurricanes after us, too!
what's the odds of being left-handed in the world?   About 10% of people all over the world are left-handed (Mcmanus, 2002). However, if you are wondering risks/odds, one area may be in familial sinistrality (how many family members you ahve that are left-handed).\n\nHandedness runs in families, and  even having a grandparent (who it can be argued will have be of little imitative effect) who is left-handed increases a person’s chance of being left-handed. The effects of parental sinistrality are seen below \n\n Effects of parental sinistrality (McManus, 2002)\n\nParents’ handedness (respectively)/ Percentage of left-handed children\n\nRight & Right   9.5%\nRight & Left    19.5%\nLeft & Left     26.1%\n\n\nIt is evident that children born to at least one left-handed parent are more likely than the rest of the population to be left handed.\n\nI hope that helps! all the best!

Fiscally Responsible - Smaller Government? David Walker, the head of the Government Accountability Office, official bookkeeper for Congress, said at a briefing last week that the $760 billion accrual deficit "amounts to $156,000 of debt for every man, woman and child in America. For a family, it's like having a $750,000 mortgage -- and no house."\n\nAre you kidding me?  Can Republicans actually run as the "conservative" party?\n\nNot "Tax and Spend" or even "Borrow and Spend".  It's like a 16 year-old spolied brat with a credit card.\n\nAnyone know why the GOP is supposedly known for being for smaller government? Both parties are prone to overspending because of the nature of our political system. However, the Bush era has certainly made it difficult for a rational person to see the Republicans as fiscally conservative. \nI guess as long as they try to keep taxes low and disregard the impact on the deficit, they think they are conservative.\nThey can still point their fingers at the "tax and spend" liberals who want to have a better balance between revenues and expenditures. For my money, I'd rather raise taxes than run up the kind of deficit we now have.\nIt's also the case that Republicans in general do not mind spending on the military and on corporate aid. They just don't like the evil "social" programs. Objectively, the rich have gotten richer during Bush's reign, and that seems quite okay with the Republicans.

If you believe in strict evolution over creationism, then what is the exact forumla for life? ie What chemical molecules does one put togther in order to make a very simple living organism?

Add lime as garnish.\nLife's too short to be serious, have a MARGARITA and relax!
Should the new Yankees Stadium be made? voters,viewpoints,both side of the argument Not very happy with the ideea...  Being a Yankee fan all my life, I relish the history associated with the stadium...  It's something that cannot be replaced..  All the greatness of the franchise, all 26 world championships (hopfully a few more before its torn down), etc. will be missing from the Stadium, sure it will always be a part of the Yankees history, but its going to lose its symbolism..\n\nAt the same time thouogh, I will forever be a Yankee fan wherever they play...  And in time I will accept it, which it looks like we will have to being the fact that its already in planningh

What are some good jobs for stay at home moms?   This is one of those things that works for some women, and some not, depending on who you are.\n\nYou could always try selling makeup (Mary Kay, Avon), Home-Interior, or Pampered Chef. I know a lot of housewives who do this and make good money off of it. Most of them you succeed in based on how much work you put into it, so its all up to you on how successful you want to be. I would suggest you check out some of their websites. These people are always looking for new faces to sell their products (its helps their company grow!).

What's a good mutual fund to invest in?? I need to put some money in an IRA before April 15.  I am not planning to retire for over 30 years.  I am willing to take a risk, so it doesn't have to be a sonservative fund.  Any good China/Asian funds?? 1.   Don't go to anyone asking you to contact them on this forum.\n\n2.   Learn "asset allocation". It is the number one predictor of successful investing for the long term (#2 is low fees).\n\n3.   Take a year to learn. As you're learning you can invest the money in an S&P500 ETF or go to Vanguard for the S&P500 Index Fund. (Open the IRA at Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, etc). Do this until you're ready to diversify. Although the China/Asian fund may be a good idea... it's not the place to start!\n\nGOOD LUCK
Is pornography being more widely accepted? The legal, non-violent softcore and hardcore stuff. I'm not sure that it's more widely accepted, but the supply has increased exponentially. This is a case where the supply actually creates the demand.\n\nThe increased demand, in turn, finances the development of more pornographic material. It's a vicious cycle, but I think the way out of it is to create more opportunities for men and women to mingle in real life. It's just more fun.

How do I know she is single or interested? She works at a drug store by my house and I do not want to make it akward in the future. I am 24 and she seems to be about the same age. how do you know she is single and interested? well the answer is: you don't!! and you won't unless you ask or somehow figure out a way to get to know her better..i.e. by sparking up a conversation and taking it from there! so far you've got really vague assumptions of her age for example..so the only way to find out real hard facts is to make a move and spark up casual conversation and if she responds positively you're on the right track! good luck!

what is the best efficiency of solar-to-electricity energy conversion that one has achieved till now?   Efficiency of photovoltaic energy depends on many factors:\n\n- Wavelength of Light: When light strikes the surface of a solar cell, some photons are reflected and do not enter the cell. Other photons pass through the material, some are absorbed but only have enough energy to generate heat and don't create charge carriers\n\n- Recombination: Charge carriers—which are electrons and holes—in a solar cell may inadvertently recombine before they make it into the electrical circuit and contribute to the cell's current.\n\n- Natural Resistance: The natural resistance to electron flow in a cell decreases cell efficiency.\n\n- Temperature: Solar cells work best at low temperatures, but solar cells work with sun light wich increases its temperature.\n\n- Reflection: When light arrives to any surface, a percentage of light will be reflected. A cell's efficiency can be increased by minimizing the amount of light reflected away from the cell's surface.\n\n- Electrical Resistance: Larger electrical contacts can minimize electrical resistance, but covering a cell with large, opaque metallic contacts would block too much incident light.\n\n- Quantum Efficiency: is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the solar cell to the number of photons.\n\nbecause of that silicon solar cell efficiencies vary from 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 30% or higher with multiple-junction research lab cells (gallium arsenide or indium selenide).\nSolar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available mc-Si solar cells are around 12%.

Does a corporation or DBA still need to trademark their name? I know they have to trademark their logos but what about just the name? The choice to trademark is not related to a company name or DBA (Doing Business As). Trademarking is done to protect your interests and rights in a name or phrase.  If your primary brand in the market is your company name (or DBA), trademarking is a good idea.  If your main brand in the market is a product, I recommend trademarking that.\n\nYou can go on the US PTO web site and submit trademarks yourself.  There is alot of information on the USPTO website on the rules and guidelines.  It takes about 1 year or so for an application for go through (or be denied).  Once you have applied for trademark (or service mark), make sure you label all of your sales, marketing and corporate materials with SM or TM.\n\nRelated to your question might also be whether you own the Internet URL for the company or DBA.  You can have a trademark on something, but not have rights to the URL.
Can someone give me reasons why commercials insult our intelligence?   marketing firms think they know more than us, and so they behave accordingly.  In addition, they want to educate us (they call it informing us), but it has a negative consequence when their ego gets in the way.  That's my take. Please don't get insulted by my answers -- just another point of view.

how tall is the leaning tower of pisa?   Tower of Pisa\nThe tilting of the structure is not new. Soon after this 800-year-old campanile (free standing bell tower) was begun, workers noticed a risky inclination caused by soft subsoil. Partial remedies were applied and the architecturally flawed tower was completed about 70 years later.\nOver the centuries the tilt angle of the 56-meter (182-feet) tall Leaning Tower of Pisa continued to increase. Today the top edge lists about 5 meters (16 feet) from the perpendicular, creating a gravity-defying appearance.\nSome experts predict an any-year-now collapse, others believe that the current restoration project will save this world wonder.

Asking on behalf of a friend.? I have a girl and she ask for my advise on a problem she is having,ok she is with this guy for 4 years she love him and it seems he love her too but up to this day he have not taken her to meet his family and he met her family, her mother adores him. I told her he is unfair and he is not serious about her. I am wrong to say that? what do you say? The fact of the matter is that he may not want her to meet his family because he's embarrassed by them.  He might have a very good reason why he doesn't want her to meet his family.  She should just ask him why she hasn't met them yet.  There is no use speculating when you can simply ask him and find out the truth.

Why are the Flyers hated so much?, they always get booed in Toronto during the draft, what's up with that? Doesn't anyone like us? Actually, Perfessor (How are you?), people love to hate them! The Flyers have been, for as long as I can recall, a bunch of huge brutes (very talented brutes, mind you) that have been near, or at the top of hockey. I respect them - but my allegiance to the NY Blueshirts prevents me from doing any more than that. I don't hate them, though. Those that do hate them are probably just jealous, especially in Toronto. Can you imagine... a team from Philly consistently kicking the butts of a team from the birthplace of hockey. Oh, the humanity of it all!

Is it ok to pull rpcinfo without permission?   This seems like a legal question and with all due respect to the Internet and "Yahoo!

What happens beyond there depends on the extent of the probing you did and any possible damage as a result. \n\nYour best bet is to speak to the server admin first.

If a user uses (HTTP over SSL) over encrypted channel, is the user still vulnerable to spyware tt obtain p/w? If a user uses https (HTTP over SSL) over encrypted channel, is the user still vulnerable to spyware that uses Trojan Horse backdoor to obtain the user's login ID and password when accessing Internet Banking? In a word, yes.\nEncryption only covers the transit between your computer and the bank's.  Its purpose is to protect against malicious third parties on the network, packet sniffing and listening to connections.  Once the data gets to the end computer (either end), it has to be decrypted in order to be of any use.  Cleverly-written trojans could snoop the password before it was encrypted or after it was decrypted.

How can I sweat more when I work out? Apparently sometimes your face gets really red when you work out because you don't sweat enough and it's humid.  Both are the case for me.  It has something to do with blood vessels expanding and pushing toward the skin.  Should I drink more water or what? When you sweat, it means your body is working hard, causing your face to turn red. Its so embarrassing isn't it! I had the same problem, until I drank Gatorade. I don't know why, but it helps.

If they go out on a few dates and things look like they might be going good then I would tell them.  I also agree with telling the guy that she is on meds and she is doing well with no recent episodes.  There are guys out there that are caring and considerate.  If this scares them off then they weren't worth the time.  Good luck to you sister!

What's the craziest thing you saw on a subway? I was on the subway the other day and saw a man masterbating which disgusted me ... blah!! So what's the craziest thing you ever saw on public trasportation? Having a large gun (automatic pistol, probably a 45 or a 9mm) shoved in my chest by a guy wanting money, of which I only had $3.23 on me and/or my leather jacket, then a guy at the end of the car started talking crazy, distracted the guy with the gun long enough for a REALLY big dude to grab my coller, pull me out of my shock and my seat and yank me to the next car, then at the next stop he shoved me out of the car and told me to run. I wanted out of there so bad, I never turned to thank him for saving my life.

I'm a mute? I was born with undeveloped vocal cords. I've always had so many thoughts I wanna say but sign language sucks. I've been called so many names in my life, and 17  years of it is too much. Is there anything I can do? It can be hard, but cheer up, your writing seems completely fine, you can use it as an expression of your thoughts.\nAs for the names, ignore them. People are like that. They call names to anyone who's even the slightest bit different. But you know, you should just appreciate Life as it is, because imagine how a blind person would feel, not being able to see the world and it's beauty.\nThere's always someone else less fortunate than we are, we should always stop to give our thanks for the blessing we have.\nIf they really get on your nerve, I bet there's one sign language you can show them. It's so universal that even a 5 year old kid would know it. Just point your third finger. \n\nI think you should write. It will get so many things, thoughts, and emotions off your chest. Write a diary. Write a short story. \nReally, it will not only improve your english, but maybe you'd even get an award-winning book one day!\n\nWriting for me is a great way to express what the spoken word cannot. And I'm sure it will be for you.\n\nJenova\n(d.yuffie@gmail.com)

what is the term "cash value" mean on a whole life insurance policy?   A whole life insurance policy is actually two pieces in one.\nOne piece buys just the life insurance.\nBut the other piece is an investment much like any other cash investment you make.\nThis "other piece" is the cash value of the policy.\nOver the years the cash value will build up and can become substantial.\nSometimes it builds up so much that it can be used to pay the premiums on the policy.\n\nThe other kind of life insurance called 'term' insurance is just the first part of the policy....the pure life part.\n\nYou can probably guess which one is more expensive.\n\nWhole life costs a lot more than term life and some people prefer to just buy term and save the cash to invest themselves.  The key is how diligent you would be in actually following through on investing the savings.  If you don't want to bother with the investing part of it, buy whole life.\nIf you want more options and control then buy term and use what you would have paid above that as investment.
which one is false ? let x<0,0<y<1,z>1 which of the following is FALSE ?\n\na)(x^2-z^2) has to be positive\nb)yz can be less than one\nc)xy can never be zero\nd)(y^2-z^2) is always negative\n\nQuestion:\n\nmy question is, should i assume numbers  x,y,z which satisfy those conditions {x<0,0<y<1,z>1} and start testing  each of the answer ?\n\nsay, i took x=-1  , y=.5 , z=2\n\nbut , you know the problem could be, if i choose badly  then everythin would be messed up.\n\nand if i try to solve this problem algebrically, then it would be difficult and time consuming.\n\n\nHow do i solve this problem quickly and correctly ?\ncan you give some tips ?\n\nthank you I would try to pull out the inherent properties in the problem as they relate to the possible choices.  For example, in this one, we have:\n\nx < 0\n0 < y < 1\nz > 1\n\nFor (a), we are told that x^2 - z^2 is always negative.  In this case, we want to either note that x^2 - z^2 factors into (x+z)(x-z) or that x^2 = (-x)^2.  Both would suggest that we can make x^2 - z^2 ZERO by choosing any x = -z (e.g. z = 2, x = -2) so (a) is immediately shown FALSE.\n\nFor (b), we note that if z > 1, 0 < 1/z < 1 so that we can let y = 1/z.\n\nFor (c), we simply note that the product of 2 nonzero Real numbers can never be zero.\n\nFor (d), we either note that y^2 - z^2 = (y+z)(y-z) so that we have the product (positive + positive)(smaller # - bigger #) = (positive)(negative) = negative or that squaring a positive number less than 1 will only make the number smaller while squaring a positive number greater than 1 will only make the number bigger so that we get smaller # - bigger # = -#.\n\nTherefore some sort of algebraic analysis is usually the fastest way to attack these problems.  Obviously though, seeing all these tricks takes an understanding and familiarity with algebra.  However, many of the algebraic techniques you need for standardized tests is actually captured in this one problem.\n\nIt'll also help to know when to reverse inequality signs.  For this, understanding increasing/decreasing functions is critical.  For example, if you're subtracting 10 from both sides of an inequality, you look at the graph of y = x - 10 and see that it is strictly increasing (i.e. the larger the values you plug in, the larger the ones you get).  Therefore, in this case, you would not reverse the inequality sign.  If you were multiplying by -2 you would see a strictly decreasing graph and would therefore reverse the inequality sign.\n\nIf you need to guess, plugging in values such as -1, 0, and 1 where appropriate are best for counterexamples.  Also in cases with questions such as above as "which one is false", look for answers that appear to be broader in scope.  For example, (c) is pretty narrow.  All it says is that xy cannot obtain one specific value so it is likely to be true.  We can also look at the wording for clues.  (b) uses weak wording: CAN (without the never) is not very restrictive, and in fact, it can be argued on a technicality that (b) is never false.  For example, "pigs can fly" is true in an imaginative person's dreams.  (a) and (d) both use strong working, but (a) is broader.  x can assume ANY value less than 0 whereas y must be between 0 and 1, exclusively.  Lastly, look for choices that are equivalent.  If x > 0 and x^2 > 0 are both possibilities, we can eliminate both since they are equivalent conditions. and they can't both be TRUE/FALSE when we are only allowed to pick one or the other.

what is the correct tire pressure for a hybrid bicycle?   As a mountain bike mechanic, I typically recommend this to my customers...\n\nAll bike tires will come with a range listed on the side with hybrids typically being between 60-100 psi.  It is important to adjust the tire pressure to the type of terrain you are riding.  If you are primarly riding on the road, I would look to inflate the tire to as close to the maximum pressure as possible.  This will give you the best surface contact and best speed/acceleration.  If you are doing a more rail trail style where you will be on a crushed limestone style path or a packed, unpaved surface, I would recommend deflating to the middle of the range or the upper 3/4 of the range.  If you have decided to take the hybrid off road more and choose to ride a more mountain bike style terrain I would use the lower end of the range.  \n\nIt is important not to under inflate your tires because the pressure on them could cause the tube to pop or you could experience what is called a pinch flat, where your tire gets stuck between 2 rocks and pops.  But also make sure not to inflate the tire beyond capacity because you can pop the tire under too much pressure.  But by following the above guidelines, you should be good to go.
how did slaves respond tothe way that they were treated?   It really depends on the slave owner during that era. Some slaves were treated badly there is no doubt about that but you must also remember that there is always two sides to a coin.  Not all slave owners were horrible to the slaves. In fact at one point when the slaves were freed some actually stayed with there owners and became crop sharers. Continuing to do what they were doing prior to being freed. \n\nI live in the south and am very proud to be southern. I never owned a slave nor did any member of my ancestors in fact my grandmother worked along side the coloreds in the cotton fields less than 50 years ago.
what is the average life span for someone who has rheumtoid arthritis?   As far as I know, RA is thought to shorten the lifespan of a person by 10 - 15 years.  This is probably due more to the medications you have to take and decreased quality of life and inability to exercise and rest properly that has shortened the lifespan, not the disease itself.  \n\nHowever, with some of the newer biologic meds, like Enbrel, I think this may become less of an issue in the future because damage to the joints can be slowed and prevented, leading to a better quality of life, thereby increasing the quantity. (Just my guess... I'm not a doctor, but it seems logical.)\n\nYou can check out http://www.arthritis.org for info on RA, and there is a very helpful discussion board there as well.
how do I get enough weight on a light weight bass fishing lure. I could not cast without backlash.? I used to bass fish with my boyfriend when I was a teenager. I have forgotten so many things about it. (It has been years) Last year I got an open face reel and fished for bass. I caught one!  I used a spinner bait which was the only one that had enought weight for me to cast it. I know I can adjust the reel, but I dont know how! Do I add weight to something that is light? First off are you using your spinning reel or a bait caster? If your using the spinning reel you shouldn't get a backlash unless the line is just falling off the reel, in that case you may want to try a different line and I belive the person above answered pretty well on a bait caster. You can use what they call a screw-in weight or a slip sinker booth of these sinkers you will put your line through the sinker and then tie your hook, you can probably get bullet weights at walmart or kmart stores( slip sinker). The screw-in type sinkers you will have to go to dick's sporting goods, gander mountain, Basspro, or Cabella's. For line I would recommend Fire line ( a Braid) or if you can get access to some new line they just came out with last year called GAMMA line ( it's like a mono) but is extremely stong I have used it and I'm verry pleased with it, I used 8 lb. test and caught two under docks and had no problem hauling them out. I fish in local tournments in Western NY. Also fish the Walmart BFL in NY and Virginia. If your close and want to go fishing some time drop me a line ( bmck33@yahoo.com). hope this helps you some, Bill

What has contributed to America's obsession with political correctness? Or, is it even a problem?   It started out with an effort to give respect to others. Too many loud mouth experts demanding to be heard on the subject of hurt feelings. Then unfortunately politicians got involved! You know that as a specie, they nothing about earning respect as to getting a free gift. If anyone is going to poop in the drinking water its these people. Did not seem to be worth the fight so most people went along, till now. Now we realize we have been quiet too long, nothing has changed, only that things have gotten worse. Politicians are still taking the money & not doing the job. Black leaders are still demanding respect when the should be making a case for more opportunities for people, better schools & teachers. Do you think it is really necessary to live in grang ridden, falling down houses that get burned down every so often. I don't. Now so many others want to go the same rout & our "leaders" un " " can't stand up like adults; they are too use to running away.

how can we controll air pollution?   There are all kinds of particles in the air which someone might consider pollution.  Oxygen, for example.  Anaerobic bacteria consider our clean, breathable air to be horribly polluted with oxygen.\n\nI presume you don't want to remove the oxygen from the air.  We want the air to be hospitable to our own life forms and those which we depend on for our survival.  In that case, we need to continue to advance technologically.\n\nFor most of the earth's 4.6 billion year history, the air has been filled with all kinds of bad chemicals that are toxic to humans.  Only recently (in terms of the earth's existence) has our air been "clean" for humans to breathe.  We have no reason to believe that nature will preserve this balance indefinitely, so it makes sense that we have to proactively work to clean our air.\n\nIn order to develop this kind of technology, resources must be available to devote toward such research.  This means we need to stop our governments from siphoning the resources from the most productive (richest) members of society and putting them toward unprofitable uses.\n\nIn areas where pollution is the biggest concern, the quality of air (or water, etc.) becomes more and more valuable to the residents.  They become willing to put more and more resources toward developing technologies to clean the air, which in turn makes it profitable to do.  This is impossible to do when the resources have been stripped from the producers of wealth and put toward failed socialist experiments.\n\nIn short, we need to keep the government out of the economy, because the markets with the most freedom tend to become the wealthiest.  The wealthiest economies are the only ones who can devote resources toward cleaning up the environment.  When people are worried about their next meal, they're not too worried about some abstract theory about the environment 100 years from now.

How do you go about finding information on where a relative was buried in England? Also any information about the death records system, burials of paupers, the process for obtaining a burial in the london area (including...is that even possible). Am writing a story including this and clearly I know nothing. OK: multiple part answer for a multiple part question:\n1) where were they buried: this information is virtually impossible to come by in the UK apt from specialist Genealogical services (there is no central registry of burials)\n\n2)Death records are available from the Pyblic Records Office (google it) - but i think you have to wait 100 years before the information is released.\n\n3) Pauper's burials haven't existed in the UK since 1947 (the founding of the 'Welfare State')\n\n4) If you die in london and nobody claims your remains, you will probably be buried/cremated in London according to your will.

I discovered porn in my 14 year old son's bedroom.  What have other parents done in a similar situation? I have suspected he has started masturbating.  Should I ignore it, make a big deal of it, or just talk to him about it? If you want to embarrass him, make a big deal out of it. If not, just ignore it. He is 14, this is a normal thing for him. What is wrong with masturbating? Would you rather he be experimenting with girls? For now let him have his privacy. But you might want to have that talk soon. Don't make an issue of it, just say something like, "Hey, son; When I was cleaning your room/gathering clothes (or whatever it was you were doing in his room...) I found some things that make me think we should talk about sex." I told my son that I understand that it is normal for his hormones to be raging out of control at 14 and if he had questions, I preferred he talked to me about it so he could get the straight dope on it. I did not want him learning it on the street where they are not as likely to tell him about AIDS and other STDs. We had serious chats about it and I told him I would be a hypocrite if I told him "DON'T have sex at your age." He is now 20 and is still a virgin. I suspect that won't be for much longer - much to my dismay - but he has a girl that he is talking about marrying. My only baby will soon be out of my home and in his own! 8>(

They have actually reached the postseason every year from 1991 to 2005, except for 1994. As someone mentioned earlier, nobody made the postseason in '94 because of the strike. But the Braves can still claim 14 straight division titles.

so guys tell me the speed of planet earth?   Basic Answer \nThe circumference of the Earth at the equator is 25,000 miles. The Earth rotates in about 24 hours. Therefore, if you were to hang above the surface of the Earth at the equator without moving, you would see 25,000 miles pass by in 24 hours, at a speed of 25000/24 or just over 1000 miles per hour. \n\nMultiply by cosine of your latitude to see how fast the Earth is rotating where you are. \n\nEarth is also moving around the Sun at about 67,000 miles per hour. \n\nAdvanced Answer \n\nIf by "turning" you mean the rotation of the Earth about its axis (where axis just means the straight line between the North and South poles) it is quite easy to figure out how fast any part of the Earth's surface is moving. \n\nThe Earth rotates once in a few minutes under a day (23 hours 56 minutes 04. 09053 seconds). This is called the sidereal period (which means the period relative to stars). The sidereal period is not exactly equal to a day because by the time the Earth has rotated once, it has also moved a little in its orbit around the Sun, so it has to keep rotating for about another 4 minutes before the Sun seems to be back in the same place in the sky that it was in exactly a day before. \n\nAn object on the Earth's equator will travel once around the Earth's circumference (40,075.036 kilometers) each sidereal day. So if you divide that distance by the time taken, you will get the speed. An object at one of the poles has hardly any speed due to the Earth's rotation. (A spot on a rod one centimeter in circumference for example, stuck vertically in the ice exactly at a pole would have a speed of one centimeter per day!). The speed due to rotation at any other point on the Earth can be calculated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude of the point. (If you are not familiar with cosines, I wouldn't worry about that now, but if you can find a pocket calculator which has a cosine button you might like to try taking the cosine of your own latitude and multiplying that by the rotation speed at the equator to get your own current speed due to rotation!). \n\nThe Earth is doing a lot more than rotating, although that is certainly the motion we notice most, because day follows night as a result. We also orbit the Sun once a year. The circumference of the Earth's orbit is about 940 million kilometers, so if you divide that by the hours in a year you will get our orbital speed in kilometers per hour. We are also moving with the Sun around the center of our galaxy and moving with our galaxy as it drifts through intergalactic space!

i have to buy my own place since im getting a divorce and i have been dateing? this guy for 3 months and really like him and i was considering seeing is maybe he wants to buy a place together since he only is renting now.is this a bad idea? If you are in the process of divorce perhaps it is a bit soon to be taking such a big step as to get a place with another guy. Perhaps you would do well to consider taking time to be with yourself to reflect on your marriage and what went wrong. I don't know how long your were married but you spent time in that relationship and gave it your energy. Now you have a chance to devote time to yourself. If this guy really likes you he will be around. That is my two cents. Sorry to hear about your divorce.

Though money doesn't buy happiness, what's the minimum income need to be happy in the U.S.? I heard it's about in the 30K-40K range.  Agree or disagree? With the rising cost of living, I would think that it would require more than that to at least provide the basic necessities of life for the average family (2 parents, and 2 children). I would think that it would have to be at least $60K, but I guess that also depends of geographical location, among other things...

What shape do you have to be in if you want to start being a cheerleader for your school?   Fit and slightly muscular. It'll take quite a bit of energy to run up and down the fields shouting yourself hoarse. Also, if it's stunting, you'd need to be even more fit/muscular because you'd have to support the cheerleaders at the top. To be the cheerleader at the top, you'd have to be small in physique, thin and less than 100 pounds so that the other girls can support you.\n\nI hope this helped.=)
In Maryland, how far does a lit charcoal grill need to be away from an apartment building? Specifically, in Montgomery County.  I know one cannot cook on a balcony.

The provisions of this section shall not apply to townhouses, row houses or other multi-family dwellings where all dwelling units are side by side and none are superimposed above another."

What percentage of the world's copyrights are still controlled by their original creators?   well they used to only be 25 years from the date copywritten, but disney changed that in 1992 with the extension of copyrights to 100 years instead. I found that odd since disney inc. made most of they movies based on works that had expired copyrights. Ever noticed that. But the copyrights are actually usually owned by the publishers who commissioned the writers. Only a few writers actually own there own works. I know that since I tried to be a writer, and when the first checks came I thought they were a bit short, but the publishers lawyers explained it all to me. But the persentage is about 30%-45% who still have there works controlled by them.

How can I get get a girl to like me as more than a friend? Here's the deal: I have been friends with this girl for, like, three years now. I want her to be more than friends. I think there's a chance that she likes me, too, but I want to be fairly sure before I go ahead. How can I do this.\nThanks,I really appreciate you guys,\ngarnickk Not an easy thing to do.  Try teasing her like she is your kid sister,( Don't be mean) and act like you don't care whether she likes it or not. And don't always be there.  Give her a chance to miss you a little. \n  One very important thing to remember, There's more than one fish in the sea and enough to go around.  If you're not catching anything in this spot,move to another.

i need help getting my boyfriend back? My boyfriend of 2 years left me yesterday. I asked his friends why he decided to leave me now, and their response is that when he found out i have leukemia, he freaked out because his little sister died of leukemia, and he thinks im going to die too. Last night my dad and mom who are both doctors sat down with him and told him that they got me the best doctor money can afford, so theres nothing to be scared about. But he still kept his orignal decision. how can i get him back? I am so sorry sweetie about your condition but with science being what it is I am sure you will be okay.  As far as your boyfriend my original reaction was what a bastard! But he is still mourning his sister and maybe he can't go through with losing someone else who is close to him.\n\nYou can't make him come back to you, sorry to say you have to respect his decision and concentrate on getting better.  If he truly loved you he would be there for you and what a horrible way to find out the truth but at least you know now what he's made of.  He is still in shock so let him be, you deserve to have someone who loves you unconditionally and will always be there for you.\n\nThank God you have a wonderful support team in your parents.  Surround yourself with positive people and keep a positive attitude.  You have a major battle to contend with right now so focus on you.  Build your fortress and protect yourself.\n\nI wish you all the best and know you will be okay in every aspect of your life.  Let God and let go.

"What is going on there?" \nIn an awed whispering voice the BABy answered, "The search team just landed the hello-copper."\nAlarmed& more concerned me asked, "What r they searching?\nStill whispering, BABy replied along with giggle: \n"FOR ME."

Do you  think America Will Succseed the war Against Muslims? or this will be their final Colonial Dictatership   The war is not against Muslims, it's against terrorists and many of them just happen to claim to be muslim, though their actions are against the dictates of the Quran so I don't know how they can claim to be muslim in the first place.\n\nWhether or not the war will ever end and a clear winner determined remains to be seen.  Personally, I feel we, the American people, were dragged into this war under false pretenses and now the ones responsible for starting it are just trying to figure out how to get themselves out of the quagmire they've created.
how much steel is there left on earth?   Steel is not an element, like oxygen, or a chemical compound, like water, but an alloy of iron and carbon, in which the two substances are mixed together physically, but not bound by any fundamental interaction.  So the limiting factor in steel manufacturing is the amount of iron available in easily mineable and refineable state.  Iron is one of the most common elements on earth, composing some 5% of the earth's crust.  \n\nDue to its high availability, and the fact that iron is not created nor destroyed in the steelmaking process, it is not exactly accurate to think of it as a question of how much steel is "left", but how much can be profitably exploited at current price levels.  The answer to that question is "a lot".\n\nEl Mutun in Bolivia is the richest provider of iron ore in the world, and it alone contains 40 billion tons of reserves.  For conmparison's sake, world consumption of Pig iron, the basic conponent of most steel, hovers around 500-600 million tons.  So El Mutun alone contains enough iron ore to provide 60-80 years of steel consumption.

How did Planck influence the development of modern atomic theory?   Planck was one of the people who was thinking of energy as being delivered in discrete amounts or bundles.  This was one of the clues that lead Einstein to conclude in his 'Photo-electric Effect' experiments that, again, energy was being absorbed at only very specific frequencies and possibly in specific bundles of energy.\n\nThen you get to thinking of light as photons to carry the energy and materials seem to only absorb special kinds of bundles of energy and some guys in Stockholm start thinking that energy changes in atoms occur in discrete quanta.  Neils Bohr and friends were trying to come up with equations to describe the orbit of the electron around the nucleus and put some of the Planck stuff together with the Einstein stuff and came up with the idea that electrons could only change orbits according to the energy quanta that they absorbed and emitted.\n\nFrom all this we get the basics of quantum mechanics, sub-atomic orbital mechanics, lasers, fluorescent lights, bunches of stuff :).
Is he trying to get my attention? theirs this guy i like and im not sure if he likes me back. at this party he was acting so nice and he was flirting with me by blowing bubbles at me and throwing some bubble juice on me. this was for fun but he started it. then he would sit by me inside and start talking to me. now at school when we switch classes (hes not in my class) im guessing hes trying to get me to notice him because hell always try to make me laugh and hell be like doing crazy dances around me and doing funny things, cause i do like a funny guy, (the things he will do are cute) when we past. and today we had a nice conversation in the lunch line. what do you think. does he like me or what? Yep, that sounds like flirting to me... usually when guys flirt with me, they get goofy and try to make me laugh. Or they tease a lot. That seems to be what this guy's doing. If the goofy stuff is directed to you, its flirting. I'm thinking he likes you... good luck, girl!

New Agers, are you absolutely sure there is no absolute truth? the statement "there is no absolute truth" is an absolute truth claim. Truth is relative, man.  What is truth in my perception could be an untruth in yours.\n\nI am not absolutely sure of anything.  That I am absolutely sure of.  Never mind the paradox, it just means your mind is not advanced enough to understand.  Meditate twice and telepatically contact me in the morning.  \n\nThat's the best I can do for such a loaded question.

He didn't fake it

what is force?   In physics, a force is anything that causes a body with mass to accelerate--intuitively, a push or a pull. The net (or resultant) force is the sum of all the different forces acting on a body.\n\nQuantitatively, force is a vector quantity defined as the rate of change of momentum induced by the force, and therefore has a direction associated. The SI unit for force is the newton.\n\nExamples...\n\n- a person holding a dog by a rope experiences the force applied by the rope on his hand, and the cause for its pulling forward is the force transmitted by the rope.\n- while standing still gravity pulls downwards, but the floor pushes upwards, and the net force is zero.

why radha is worshipped with krishna? hindu mythology,gods Radha is krishnas girl friend, lover .\nRADHA is suppose to be part and parcel of Krishna.\nRadhas love for Krishna is pure without any expectation in return.\nLike a soul in a body Radha and Krsihna are united.\n\nKrishna is SUPER MAN .THE UNIVERSAL MAN (Avoiding the term GOD)\nAll the rest are FEMALES . If there is only a single MALE in whole universe and all the rest are FEMALES JUST IMAGINE HOW EVERY FEMALE would like to get attached to KRISHNA and embrace him and not allow him to go to any other females. \nIn such a situation KRISHNA manifests himslef into as many females as there were and thus ever female had one KRISHNA to dance with.\nThis is just a figuritive way to explain how all the beings and creations are attached to the one SUPREME being the BRHAMAN.\nRadha is the imaginary lover of Krishna .\nWITHOUT RADHA THERE IS NO KRISHNA AND WITHOUT KRISHNA THERE IS NO RADHA, \nWE ONLY SEE RADHA AND KRISHNA AS TWO SEPERATE IDENTITIES BUT OTHERWISE IT IS INDISTINGUISHABLE.

how do i graph egg flotation results? my science project invovled eggs floating. now i know why but how do i graoh my data. should i graph it on amount of salt used.. or how much it flaots or what!?!??!?!? If each container contains exactly the same amount of water, you could use the amount of salt that you place in each container.  However, if you have a way of measuring the specific gravity, such as a hydrometer, graphing by specific gravity would be a better way of doing it.

Very Argent!! NEED HELP? please can some one help me to find some pages about substitution reactions of 1- and 2- naphthols\nnote: i tried using both google and Answeres.com searsh and till now it got me no where Try the keywords substitution reactions of naphthol on yahoo. Here is a little of what I found:\nDiazonium ions are present in solutions such as benzenediazonium chloride solution. They contain an -N2+ group. In the case of benzenediazonium chloride, this is attached to a benzene ring.\n\nIn this set of reactions of the diazonium ion, the -N2+ group is replaced by something else. The nitrogen is released as nitrogen gas.\n\nThis is a good example of the use of diazonium salts to substitute things into a benzene ring which are otherwise quite difficult to attach. (That's equally true of the previous reaction, by the way.)\n\nIf you add potassium iodide solution to the benzenediazonium chloride solution in the cold, nitrogen gas is given off, and you get oily droplets of iodobenzene formed.\nThere is a simple reaction between the diazonium ions and the iodide ions from the potassium iodide solution.\n\nI found this information at the sources listed below-try it out.
the terror suspected countries list? how does it work? because apparently Bush just removed Libya from the list...although i don't recall anything happening in public which would suggest anything about libya terror/human rights record improving. maybe its a deal - you suck up to america and you dont get called a terrorist country. \nyou think if chavez stopped messing with Bush's oil calculations he might be taken off too? Actually, Lybia has been working for many years to get off of the list. The list of State Supporters of Terrorism is compiled by the US State Department, and it is based on many different things, one of which includes attempts at acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIn addition to reaching a financial understanding with the families of the Lockerbee tragedy, in the last few years Lybia has renounced their stockpile of various weapons and has invited international inspection. The Lybian government has also stated that it will no longer give monetary and protective aid to international terrorists. \n\nTo answer your other question, the Venezuelan government continues to offer monetary and protective support to leftist guerillas and terrorists in Columbia, which does a great deal to extending the tragedy in that part of the world. Yes, part of the problem between the USA and Venezuela is economic, part is personal, but part is also about the legitimate danger of terrorism to the region.
How's your team doing? Thank you for your answer and have the best weekend!:) My team is the Buffalo Sabres and we just upset the heavily favoured Ottawa Senators in their own building last night. It was a fast-paced, high-scoring see-saw affair which required overtime to finally decide it. I've the feeling this whole best-of-seven series will play out in much the same way (better get my blood pressure checked, lol). So, in answer to your question, my team is doing just great, thanks! =)\n\nAnd you have a lovely weekend, too, Moon! :)

What is the differance between MCB and MCCB in theory of operation?   There are wide range of circuit breaker equipment, both MCB and MCCB(Molded Case Circuit Breaker). The range of MCB boards are highly durable and allow the installer maximum flexibility.\nThere is a huge number of variations with Current ratings from 6 Amps to 40 Amps. \nDifferent series including High rupture capacity, Single to four Pole. \nHigh breaking capacity: 20 - 15 - 10 - 6 K A Nominal rated currents from 0.5 to 63 A Wide range of the executions for both the MCBs and the accessories combined main contacts. \n\nThe traditional molded-case circuit breaker uses electromechanical (thermal magnetic) trip units that may be fixed or interchangeable. An MCCB provides protection by combining a temperature sensitive device with a current sensitive electromagnetic device. Both these devices act mechanically on the trip mechanism.\n\nDepending upon the application and required protection, an MCCB will use one or a combination of different trip elements that protect against the following conditions:\n\nThermal overloads; Short circuits; and Ground faults.

Where in Nevada is prostitution legal? Nevada is the only state in the US where prostitution is legal, but not the whole state, just only some particular cities. I would like to find out. Last I knew, it was allowed or prohibited on a county by county basis.  The more populated counties prohibit, so that prostitution is illegal in the counties that have Las Vegas, Tahoe, Carson City, Reno in them.\n\nHowever, in each of those cities, the brothels in the next legal county advertise and run shuttle services.
is she a ho? Is a girl a ho if she sleeps with me on the first night or does that mean she just likes me a lot? I think people need to stop labeling other people as a ho and they should just enjoy each other, even if it means just one night.\n\nWhy dont you ask her how she feels about you? You can usually tell if she just wanted to sleep with you for that one night or if she wants to see you again. I think it could be a little bit of both. I am sure she liked you enough to go out with you, I think sleeping with you just topped the cake! Do not label a girl as a ho just because she gave it up....you did the same thing, dont forget that.
Could everyone answer this, please? Non Muslims:-\n\nDo YOU any (( good things )) about Islam ? Yes. It provides a good grounding for actions. An understood way of behavior that allows one many things to count on from other Muslims.

It promotes education and the work ethic. It promotes duty to your society and other believers.
hOW MANY HOURS SHOULD A 1ST GRADE HOMESCHOOLER SPEND DOING SCHOOLWORK?   here is the answer from homeschool.com\n\nA: The short answer to this, as kids today are likely to say is, "24-7." Again, think in terms of being free from the way government schools go about educating children. If you like schedules, stick with theirs. But realize that an evening trip to the grocery store, a weekend visit to the nature center, and even bedtime story hour are times available for learning together.\n\nSome families sit down and do all their academic (book) work for a couple of hours each morning, freeing up the children's afternoons for personal pursuits. Others scatter book work throughout the day, or note that their children might sit down with a math book for 2 weeks straight, then not touch it again for a month. Sometimes families simply go through the course of a day and only take advantage of "teachable moments" as they arise.\n\nAs you begin to homeschool, and if you just observe what takes place in the course of a week or so, you'll begin to notice a "rhythm" - your family's personal rhythm. Here's where you'll get your best clues as to the best times for particular pursuits. Just one word of warning: When I did this, I saw that two of my children were night owls! Just about the time my mind and body were winding down, they were just getting into gear! This was definitely an impetus to help them become independent learners very quickly!\n\n\nhere is my answer:  spend about 2 focused hours learning between breakfast and lunch, and let them follow thier own pursuits in the afternoon.\n\nthe answer for your child;  try out different things.. the answer for your kid may be different than mine.

Why don't the British speak (better: pronounce) proper english? When i travelled around the world i could talk to almost everybody in english (with a dutch accent obviously). However only the British (and to a lesser degree the Aussies and Kiwi's, but not the Americans) were so hard to understand. And I was not the only one who experienced that. How come? Ignore the insulting answers. The reason you have difficulty with English is because in England we have very strong regional accents and even English people have difficulty understanding each other sometimes. The strongest accents are those in London (Cockney), Birmingham (Black Country). North East (Geordie). Devon and Cornwall (West Country), Liverpool (Scouse) and North (Lancashire and Yorkshire). For example in London the word 'Face' might sound like 'Fice', in Birmingham 'Time' will sound like 'toime' and 'tea' will sound like 'toy'. In Liverpool 'work' will sound like 'werk'. In the North East 'go down there' will come out as 'gan dan yan'. In the West Country 'I like that' would sound like 'Oi loike tha'. In Lancashire and Yorkshire the accent is very flat and letters left out so 'where are you going?' would come out as 'wer yer goin?'. Also lots of people now don't pronounce their words correctly, the most irritating example being the dropping of the letter 't' from words such as 'party' which sounds like 'par'y'. Also in some parts of the country they speak so that when they finish their sentences they use an upward inflection, like the Aussies, so that the sentence sounds almost like a question.\n\nBy the way I've visited Holland and it's a beautiful place. I enjoyed my stay there immensely and Amsterdam is a great city. The people there seemed to speak English better than most English people.

what's snooker?   Snooker is a billiards sport that is played on a large (12' × 6') baize-covered table with pockets in each of the four corners and in the middle of each of the long cushions. It is played using a cue, one white ball (the cue ball), 15 red balls and 6 colours: a yellow (worth 2 points), green (3 points), brown (4 points), blue (5 points), pink (6 points) and black ball (7 points). A player wins a frame of snooker by scoring the most points, through using the cue ball to pot all the red and coloured balls. A match consists of an agreed number of frames. Snooker is particularly popular in English-speaking countries (Britain, Ireland, Canada, Australia and South Africa), and there has recently been a surge of interest in East Asia, with players from Hong Kong, China and Thailand entering the rankings. It's also very popular in Pakistan and India.

Do you think we should have a national "thin the herd day"? Everyone can go out and kill whoever they want. There is an age limit though and rules. If you're in your home or anyones home they are off limits. If they are out and about in the streets then they are fair game! Great idea.  But you would first have to get it on a ballot measure, and a majority would have to vote for it. Then, if all the people that voted for it had to kill themselves - problem solved. But if that were known before hand, nobody would vote for it. Smells funny to me. But you never know what will catch on. I'll watch my voters pamphlet.

Girlfriends...? Hi,\nwhy can't girls get along with each other?  I notice guys are a lot more passive and can remain good buds without much effort.  Girls however...there always seems to be some drama going on.  Why is it so hard for girls to get along with each other? Because girls can be easily get jealous of each other... The best way to deal with girls are not tell them something that may cause their jealousy. For example, just don't show off in front of them how great your boyfriend treats you or how happy you are with your boyfriend. They probably will think up some tricks to damage your happiness because of their jealousy!!

Can you be in love with an ex for a year, while at the same time maybe loving your current guy? confusion!!!!! The ex still loves me, and the new guy does too. I think there has to be a guy that you love more. Maybe you are holding on to past memories and you just need to let go of them, if that's what you really desire. Sometimes is just better to be alone untiil you are ready to dedicate yourself to just one person. You wouln't want your current boyfriend to have strong feelings towards any other girl, you want him to respect you and for you to be the only one in his heart... right??   If you aren't sure about something, think throught it, is better to make wise decisions now, then to later have to be stuck in a relationship that you are not sure of.
Website design? In what program is written (or how is built) a site like Yahoo! or Hotmail? I mean, I am interested on the part of it that deals with opening an email account...selecting and username and password, and creating the personal data. How is this done (software name, technology)? Well, 1st of all, for designing a web-portal (e.g. Yahoo! Google, MSN) We must design the template using Adobe Photoshp or any other one! Then, We make the pre-codes of the site using HTML and CSS language with the help of some web designer software like Macromedia Dreamweavor Now, We've got the basis of our site! We need to make it work! So, we use some programming languages and scripts which r available on the net like PHP and ASP, On the other side, VBScript and JavaScript etc... We can connect these kinda languages to MySQL or SQL in order to have a good Database... Anyways! There's a long long process in order to make a good site!...
What is the correct grammar, "If I WAS" or "If I WERE? Me and my girlfriend are always having a debate: she always use the IF I WAS, and I said its wrong. The correct one is IF I WERE... since IF is an assuming. \nnow tell me who is right? 'If I were ...' is actually a past subjunctive form.  'I was ...' is (simple) past indicative.\n\nWith most verbs in English the two forms above look the same - so we hardly even notice we're using them.\n\nIt's quite a complicated area so, to understand it, you have to start with three (basic) kinds of conditional sentence:\n\n1. If he asks, I'll help him.\n2. If he asked, I would (I'd) help him.\n3. If he had asked, I would have helped him.\n\nEach of these uses a differnt combination of tenses to convey\n\n1.  A certain future action based on a likely future condition.  (I think he could possibly ask ...)\n2. A possible future action based on a less likely future condition (I think it's nlikely he'll ask)\nAND\n3.  A (now impossible) action based on a hypothetical (and now impossible) past condition.  (He didn't ask).\n\nThe past subjunctive is used in the 'If' clause of number 2.  This is NOT actually a past tense (although it nearly always looks like one in English).  It is not about the past but about what could be at any time.\n\nThe verb 'be' is the only real exception to the rule that the past indicative and the past subjunctive verb forms look the same in English.  Hence, 'If I were you ...'.\n\nMany native speakers 'smooth out' the rule to use 'If I was you ...'.  Rather than the debate about 'What is correct?' - a more interesting question is 'Is this language change in progress?  Is the fact that the difference is now only vestigal, meaning that it is in the process of dying out (like 'whom') and other vestigal grammatical constructs in languages as they change and these items become less and less useful over time?

need help with this? write a rule of the function represented by each?\nx  y\n0  1\n1 -8\n2-17\n3 -26\n\ncan anyone help, but show me how to do this question...please..;) When I look at problems like these, I use the two-point formula. Since y is decreasing by a constant amount each time, it's ok to use the two-point formula. Basically, you choose two points...I'll choose (0,1) and (1,-8). Then, you calculate the slope, which is (y2-y1) / (x2-x1). It doesn't really matter which y or x comes first as long as they are correspondent with each other. So, the slope would be (-8-1) / (1-0), which is -9/1, which is -9. Then, plug it back into the equation y = mx + b. So, I'll use the point (0,1). 1 = -9(0) + b. 1 = 0 + b. b = 1. As a result, the function is...y = -9x + 1

Christian Democrats disapprove of false prophet Cults the Bible warns us about, do you agree???? Pat Robinson is the bellsebub, from revelations with George Bush. Right on So Fine this question is way over due. These lying warmongers aren't going to be getting into heaven that is for certain. Jesus has no testaments that say war mongering and profiteering is of God and for the elite class of nutcase Republicans. Those things are from KKK Pat Robinson and KKKarl Rove the Fascist. Democrats will rule the Congress and this will come to and end soon.

Also check with the British Council and your government. Good luck.

God has always used some median to be heard. fire roars. was the burning bush used as a median to form words.? In other words. was the burning bush able to be used to make words that could be heard by moses, utilizing the sounds of burning? Also when there were other times that God spoke, was the wind used to make audible words? Unless you are talking about statistics, I'm pretty sure you mean "medium". In fact, God does not "speak" at all. When people are said to have received direct communication from the Almighty, it is actually the Voice of God that does the talking. Not the voice of God, as in God's voice, but the Voice of God. This role was filled, I believe, by the archangel Metatron.\nThe reason for having a Voice of God is that when God says things, they are things like LET THERE BE LIGHT; not things that are appropriate for human ears. When He needs to say something like "I am what I am," He does so via the Metatron.\n\nNote: this answer is based on, and is consistent with, a lot of research into Judeo-Christian theology; not on personal belief.
If there was 'a day without an american', would you participate? On the 1st of may, mexicans and hispanic-americans made a big to-do out of their 'day without a mexican' bit. If someone organized 'a day without an american', would you stay home from work/school/etc., to show solidarity on the issue? To protest the governments inaction on the price of gas, yes. It is actually needed to get the attention of the people in charge. If solidarity was displayed then it would work, yes I would participate.

how i get rhel4 as driver image for intel em64 pro & 120gb sata hd installation for scsi controller & lan card I am trying to install redhat linux 4 as on my pc with intel 945gnt mb and samsung 120gb sata hd. But the installer giving message "no devices drives not found .........." for lan card and hard disk controller for scsi and I want driver images to make a cd, pls help For the disk i can help you. You need to go into the BIOS and change the mode of your SATA disk to Legacy from the current setting. This is because there is no support for enhanced mode for SATA disks in linux as yet. Then get the 945 chipset drivers from the intel site. they're pretty easy to install.
why do so they talk so much? well this boy i'm talking to right now is cool peoples but all of a sudden this boy named TYSHEM is tell my boyfriend that i'm cheating on him for a minute i was thinking about it cause i found out he's suppose to be cheating on me with some gurl.And all of a sudden my EX is call me back for some reason and that was my first love. what am i suppose to do?\n   And yes i do know a thing to about luv i'm old enough. Well obviously you and your current boyfriend should break up because the you have a feeling that he's cheating. If he's cheating then he has no respect for you or your feelings. You should never stoop down to his level and cheat. That's very immature. You should just call it off and do what makes you happy. Much luck!

Soundcard & Soundcard  Driver Dilemma - SB Live! card? Though it could be a coincedence of time, after my McAfee updated my PC would not play any music or video but would play system sounds. I uninstalled the soundcard and rebooted - hoping it would fix itself. But that just killed all sounds and in Control Panel, it now states "No audio device installed". But yet Device Manager shows the card *is* "working properly". I have always had this card installed and I havent downloaded or installed anything except for McAfeee's daily updates. I also tried to re-install the soundcard driver after d/l'ing from Creative, but because the PC isn't recognizing the card now, the driver wont install. I also had a 2nd card lying around and installed it, but there was no change at all - still no sound, same error mssages. If I try to open Win Media Player, the error message says WMP "is not a valid Win32 application". This just happned out of the blue and Im stumped! I use WinXp and the card is a SoundBlaster Live! Mod. #SB0220. \nThanks so much for help! re-install windows...\nIt'll take less time than trying to fix your CL sound card problem. I've spend many days trying to fix mine, got me nowhere...\nIf the problem continues, try your card to another PC. If the problem still persist, it's a hardware fault.

I think that your worst fear may be try - you might be experiencing browser hijack.\nYou should update your pc from the safe mode (update zonealarm), instal antispyware software as well as anti virus (if your zone alarm is only firewall) and try asking a friedn to run hijack this for you on your computer.\nIf nothing of this helps you should reunstal you OS using the original CD's.

Does the Strip natural cleanser work to pass a drug test??   not doing drugs helps me to pass drug tests
serious answers only please? Ok, these is strange.  My brother's girlfriend lives with us.  She just came to me and asked me if I ever heard anything strange.  thing is, I have.  I have also seen a male figure all around our house for the past four years (she just moved in few months ago). This man has clearly spoken to me once, but appears on a regular basis.  But he harrasses her in the shower.  I am really worried about her.  He also watches me and my four year old sleep.  What can we do?  I told her to tell him to go away and the remember that he can't hurt her, but trufuly I am scared he could.... OK- assuming this is a real spirit case and you are not crazy, the best thing you can do is not be afraid. He never hurt you before because you were never afraid before. It is like the movie Skeleton Key. Second: DO NOT TRY TO CONTACT HIM. You have no idea what you are doing, and you could get in way over your head in which case you could get hurt. I don't have an old family recipe for protection against spirits, so I could help you know more than a book or a google search on specifics, but there are plenty of books on protection. If you feel you need to call someone like a physic, but be aware that most are just frauds, and don't pay anything up front. I don't really have any better advice for you than that. Just don't fear him and he cannot harm you.

In-tect citation help. Is this correct? Am I missing something? The American Civil Liberties Union(ACLU) located in San Francisco is a coalition that fights for the homeless’s civil liberties.

Nebraska rapist too short to go to prison? Did anyone else see the news about the Nebraska man who is 5 feet, 1 inch tall who was sentenced to 10 years PROBATION for raping a 12 year old girl? The Judge stated he was too short to go to prison! \n\nApparently, he was living with and engaged to the girl's mother. He began molesting the girl and later repeatedly raped her. The Nebraska Judge stated something along the lines of she feared for him in prison due to his height! So, he has 10 years worth of probation, 4 months to wear a "tracking anklet," he can't be around any children, and last he has to get rid of all of his porn.\n\nI would like to know how everyone feels about this. Is being too short an excuse to avoid prison? Was he worried about his height when he was raping a 12 year old? Give me some feedback! I truely believe that there should not be any laws dictating mandatory sentences and all sentenceing should be left to a judge because no 2 crimes are really alike. \n\nBut...\n\nI do not think someone being short is valid reason for a lesser sentence.  What bothers me most is not the probation but the only 4 months of wearing an ankle bracelet and no mention of if Sex Offender Therapy is required. A Judge should have descretion to sentence to probation, house arrest, a half way house, intensive therapy or whatever IF and ONLY IF after a thorough evaluation including a a psycological exam it is determined to be the most effective in rehabilitating the offender. The article did not mention if any of this was done. \n\nPrison is supposed to be about rehabilitation and not just punishment. In every state it is called the "Dept. of Corrections" not Dept. of Punishment." Yes punishment is part of it but if the criminals are not rehabilitated then they are more destined to repeat their crime.\n\nSo if the only reason is because he is short he could have spent a few years in solitary confinement.

what is the best thing to stop constant bloody noses?   Get some tissues or a damp cloth to catch the blood. \nSit or stand so your head is above your heart. \nTilt your head forward and pinch your nostrils together just below the bony center part of your nose. Applying pressure helps stop the blood flow and the nosebleed will usually stop with 10 full minutes of steady pressure - don't keep checking to see if the bleeding has stopped. \nApply a cold compress, such as ice wrapped in a cloth or paper towel, to the area around the nose. Applying pressure with a cotton pad inside the upper lip may also help.\nIf you get a nosebleed, don't blow your nose. Doing so can cause additional nosebleeds. Also, don't tilt your head back. This common practice will cause blood to run into your throat. If you swallow the blood, you might throw up. \n\nIf you've tried the steps above twice and the bleeding continues after 10 minutes, you'll need to see your school nurse or your doctor. \n\nOnce you've stopped the initial nosebleed, don't lift heavy objects or do other activities that cause you to strain, and don't blow your nose for 24 hours. Also, keep your head elevated above your heart.\n\n********************\n\nNow, if your nosebleeds are constant, won't stop, or if they happen often, you need to see a doctor. It could be an indication of something more serious.
Why prostitution is illegal in 49 states of USA? and it is allowed or tolerated in the mayotity of the countries around the world? In Nevada, we have found that it's better for it to be legal.  That way all the girls received regular health checks and get "taken out" if they are diseased.  \n\nIf it's illegal, who knows what kinds of diseases men will get otherwise.\n\nAlso, in Nevada, it is a taxable business.  I expect it's for the same reasons in the rest of the world why it is legalized.

I went at the karts with 2 family friends&fell in love with a boy,he2but couldn't show.How can Isee him again? Yesterday, I went with a two family friends at the karts(driving cars) in Agio Kosma- a place in Athens-Greece and I saw the most beautiful boy in the world!I fell in love with him and we were both looking each other in the eyes!!! But no one of us could show anything because I was with the two old family friends and maybe they would tell my mother about it, that I am small and I want boys...(I'm 17 and I am a girl, it's not bad if I like a boy, but they are old and very strict, they could never understand Anyway, last night I was crying because that boy was exactly the same as the one I had dreamed of, and maybe I would never see him again...What can I do? I thought that if I go almost everyday at the karts, maybe I'll see him again... Oh! I forgot to say that when he was leaving, he told me bye. I am 100% sure that he felt something for me and he was not just joking because people say I'm very beautiful... Please tell me what to do!!!I would give anything for him,even my life... I really like your question and would like to help u.\nBe care what u felt that day was not love but admiration because u said the boy was beautiful.\nNever love somebody because of beauty but Good habits and caring.\ni would prefer to know u personally but i am far from u .\nI am a Gambian by nationality but staying in Qatar contact me if u wish stcham1@yahoo.com
what is ufc???and oin which channel does it come???   Ultimate Fighting Championship started in the early 90's with fighters like Ken Shamrock and Royce (pronounced Hoyce) Gracie. It's a mixed martial arts full contact fighting event that up until 2 years ago could only be seen on Pay-per-view. You can watch the reality show "The Ultimate Fighter" on Spike TV. \nIf you've never seen it, it's well worth watching. It's addicting. Especially now, when boxing is soooo bad.

what is worm hole ?   Do you want the extended answer or the short answer. \n\nthe short answer is a bit like this. \nA worm hole is a hole in the space (not time) continuim that occurs at a fold in the universe that you can travel through at almost the speed of light. the other choice is a wormhole that leads to a diagonal universe that is mostly the same.\n\nHowever a wormhole is a theoretical part of physics, and until either made or found can not be proved.\n\n\nfor the long answer try looking on NASA website but be warned, it will be long and confusing.
what can you do to prevent acid rain?   Reducing air pollution (NO2 and SO2 emissions in particularly) will help prevent acid rain.\n\nAcid rain refers to rain which contained Nitric acid (HNO3) and/or Sulfuric acid (H2SO4) dissolved in it, hence its name.\nWhen Nitrogen Dioxide gas (NO2) and Sulfur Dioxide gas (SO2) dissolve in water, they form very strong and corrosive acids.  These two gasses are minor byproducts of the combustion of fossil fuels due to impurities in the fuel.  When these gasses dissolve in rain water, the rain becomes acetic and can damage things on the ground.\n\nReducing air pollution is a major step in preventing acid rain.

Is there a healthy way to lose 30 pounds in 5 weeks?   If you want to do this it is for life so you need to totally change your way of eating and exercising. This is not a diet rather than a healthy eating plan for life. So no more talking diet cause it means time limit. You will get the results you are after if you stick to this regime it is up to you. \n\nHere are the golden rules: \nInitially cut down to 1200 calories. \nExercise 6 times per week for 1 hours a day. Do three weight sessions and three cardio sessions. No gym involved. \nDon't eat carbs after 4pm, never eat carbs within 2 hours of exercise or within 1 hour of exercise. \nDrink 3 litres of water per day. You can have a green tea at the end of the day. \nLimit your fruit in take to 2 pieces per day. \nNever eat dinner after 6pm.\nAdopt of low GI eating plan this is sustainable for life!\nMake low fat dairy choices \n\nFollow this menu plan as a suggestion: \nBreakfast 7am - 1 cup hot water w lemon\n20 minutes later have a bowel of oats w water (no honey) OR\nfruit salad w low GI soy yogurt\nSnack 10am - pear or apple (both low GI)\nLunch 12.30pm - muligrain sandwich w 50g tuna & salad (no butter)\nSnack 3pm - low GI yogurt OR skim berry smoothie (no honey or banana) plenty of ice, 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup yogurt\nDinner 5.30pm - 120g grilled lean meat/fish/prawns/tofu patties (not fried) w spinach salad & mixed vegies (no whites, carbs) OR 3 egg white/soy omlette with ham, cheese and tomato\nSnack - 1 scoop of low cal low fat ice cream (if hungry)\n\nExercise is must be intense. Refer to www.bodybuilding.com for your weights routine. Never do weights two consecutive days have a cardio day in between. \n\nCardio needs to include running, go hard up stair wells and cycling. You get the most benefits from exercise when your body is totally fatigued and this is when you see changes. \n\nTo maintain you can increase calories to 1500 and reduce exercise sessions to 3-4 times per week. If weight creeps up again due to holiday period etc.. go back to 1200 cal and 6 sessions again. \n\nGood luck it worked for me it can work for anyone.

How do I build a water filer - 2 stage- for 8th grade science class? cant use ready made filters, cant use the same materials in both steps.  must use items I have at home you can try this one:  \nfirst stage: use cotton or a t-shirt.  \nsecond stage, using coffee filters (or sheets of paper).  if they are not thick enough, then put two or three.  let dirty water flow and you will see how dirt stays in the filter, and clear water comes out\n\nother material that can be useful:  take a little plastic cup, fill it with sand, pack it tight, then make a hole on the bottom.  be careful to let water run slowly, and to pack it really tight

at least how many number of human from each sex must stay alive to perpetuate human on earth after a disaster? i might be making mistake while writing the question. i think you will understand what i mean It depends entirely on how rapidly the people can increase their population. For organisms that are rapidly reproducing there isn;t any real limit to the number of individuals required. One of each will work just fine. That's because the degree of genetic diversity will be increasing simply through re-assortment, and with an increasing population mutations will be arising more than fast enough to replace any losses.\n\nThe thing we need to know is how fast you think people are going to be able to expand, and that depends entirely on where these two survivors are located. In relatively benign environments such as the eastern US or Southern India people would be able to increase their populations exponentially immediately. In those circumstances two survivors would work. In more hostile environments such as Australia or Siberia people would find life a struggle for a long time and you'd probably need a good few hundred.
I'm suffering from a problem of stammering. I didn't have this much couple of years ago. Please help me. Previously I used to stammer on uttering words starting with "a". Nowadays I'm doing bad very frequently, on various words. I know that tension, anger, much stress etc are some of the soft reasons towards stammering, but these don't play in me. Please advise me, suggest me according to your experiences of success in this matter. its a psychological problem. it is better to look for a psychologist to seriously help you on this matter.
Whats wrong with me? I get light headed and dizzy usually when I get to few calories. Im a big guy, 6'2, 220 lbs, and always try to diet, so I dont get any bigger. Anybody have experience with this. I suspect its from low blood sugar. What kind of food would be good to avoid this. You need to talk to your doctor.  Chronic low blood sugar can be dangerous.  At the very least, talk to a nutritionist about an appropriate menu plan.  (Stop dieting!)\n\nIf you were my client, I'd take a look at your medical history, talk to your doctor (assuming you gave me the OK) and teach you about the best foods to eat.\n\nYour doctor can recommend someone in your area or maybe even a good book to read that will help you understand what your body needs.
if i got to court is it definate that they'll say i cant go outta the state??   nothing is definite until the judge gives his orders...there would be arguments first, I imagine.  The only reason you would not be able to leave the state is if you are a convicted criminal on parole, or someone involved in a custody case...as for criminals, it would depend on the severity of your crime, but if you are on parole, then no.  If you are involved in a custody case, and are the custodial parent, then you will be able to move out of state only if you can convince the judge it forwards the child's best interests, and is not in anyway to thwart the parenting time of the other party.  Without any information,it's hard to say any specifics....

smoking on my balcony ok? I smoke only a few cigarettes a day.  I walk my dog in the morning and have one then, away from everbody.  If I am at home I may have 2 or 3 during the day and then one or two before bed.  Last summer my neighbor started yelling and slamming her door if i smoked on my balcony.  So I bought a smokeless ashtray.  Well summer is here again and the other day I came home to a note on my door saying if I did not stop smoking on my balcony she has been advised by a lawyer and she will have me evicted.  There is nothing in my lease regarding smoking and I smoke out back because my husband is a non smoker and I amd trying to be considerate of him.  So now I am out in a parking lot smoking because I can't smoke inside and can't smoke outside without somebody getting pissed off :(  I know its a bad habit and all the rest, but I feel like I am being kind of knocked around here.  What do you think? I would do it anyway she is probably bluffing about the lawyer or the lawyer would have written the letter. If she takes you to court you will probably win this is ridiculous if there is nothing in the lease about i think you can do whatever you want to. You are outside and it is you house on the balcony.

Hello,how is fear of blood called?   An abnormal and persistent fear of blood is called hematophobia\n\nKnown by a number of names - Hemophobia, Hematophobia, Hemaphobia, and Fear of Blood being the most common - the problem often significantly impacts the quality of life. It can cause panic attacks and keep people apart from loved ones and business associates. Symptoms typically include shortness of breath, rapid breathing, irregular heartbeat, sweating, nausea, and overall feelings of dread, although everyone experiences fear of blood in their own way and may have different symptoms.

how does charter change affect our nation?   In this, I assume "our nation" is the Philippines?\n\nThe thing to remember is that such a drastic change in the way you are governed will have long-term effects.  The strongest anti-ChaCha argument I've seen is that local members of the House are often chosen because they have the backing of local oligarchs and prominent families.  With a unicameral legislature, and no nationally-elected President, a coalition of faction can rule the nation until the next election.

how to get the credit history back to normal once it is bad?   get a small limit credit card, maybe one with a $500 limit, I suggest a gas card. All month long use it to buy gas then when the bill comes pay the balance off in full. You won't get charged intrest and if you use your gas card to buy gas you get cashback bonuses usually. By paying off your balance each month you're adding more points to your FICO score. It may take 6mos. to a year (depending on how bad you messed up your credit) but it's the quickest way to get a better score.

A problem with my cd rw drive here (details)...? i was burning a cd in Ulead Burn.Now 1.5 when suddenly an error occured and it said, "Power Calibration Error".  I clicked ok (its the only option).  Then the next time i insert a cd to it and it can't read any cd no more... HELP!!!! 9. I get a 'Power calibration error' or 'Calibration area (almost) full' error message. Why?\n\nPower Calibration is controlled by the recorder.\n\nBefore any write operation, all recorders must do a 15 step power test to determine the optimum power for writing to the CD; this is called "Optimum Power Calibration"(OPC). During the write, it continues to do this test to get the best write throughout the whole CD; this is called "Running Optimum Power Calibration" (ROPC).\nThis whole process is controlled by the recorder, though initiated by programs such as Nero. There is an area on the inner part of the CD for the test and test data info to be stored. You can use this area up to 999 times.\n\nIf you receive the "Power calibration error" or "Power calibration area is (amost) full" error message, the cause will be either poor media, poor power, or a defective recorder.\n\nPlease try the following solutions:\n\n    * Update the firmware of your recorder. Please check the manufacturer's website for the latest version.\n    * Try another brand of CD-R or CD-RW media.\n    * Try different power connectors, and for recorders, do not share power with other devices. It needs its own power connector. If the error occurs with an external recorder, the power source in the chassis could be the cause. As a test, try to take the recorder out of the external chassis and connect it internal.\n    * Try different configurations, such as taking the CD-ROM to the primary IDE bus as slave and have only the recorder connected to the secondary IDE bus as master.\n    * Send the recorder in for service.

why does myhp photosmart 7760 printer keep printing the same photo over and over no matter what I do? Im trying to print a web page and the printer keeps printing the photo that I tried to get it to print the other day when my prntr was not working.( turns out I Hhad the usb ports mixed up) When I go into printers on the control panel, it tells me that the web page I m trying to print IS the one being printed, buts its not.

Select Services And Applications, Services. Locate the Print Spooler service and double click. Click Stop. Double check the printers to ensure that no print jobs are still listed and then Restart the Print Spooler Service.\n\nSend a test print to the printer to make sure it worked... then print as normal.

high school football...? How tall should I be to play cornerback on a high school football team? Also, what should my weight be? That really depends on the relative size of the players in your league. I played DB in high school (both corners and the later free safety) and corners are usually smaller and fast, and in high school, they're usually around 5' 6" and 5' 10", occasionally taller, with weight of around 140 ~ 180.... But since corners are smaller, speed, quickness (ability to break on the ball), jumping ability, body control and tackling ability are very important. I ran a 4.6 40, but the range is between 4.3 ~ 5.0.\n\nA corner's responsibilities vary depending on the type of coverage called.  A corner will be given one of two ways to defend the pass (with variations that result in more or less the same responsibilities): zone and man-to-man. In zone coverage, the cornerback is responsible for an area on the field. In this case, the corner must always stay downfield of whoever it is covering while still remaining in its zone, always between the sideline and the opposing player. \n\nThe free safety is responsible for reading the offensive plays and covering deep passes. Depending on the defensive call, he may also provide run support. He is positioned 10 to 15 yards behind the line of scrimmage, toward the center of the field. He provides the last line of defense against running backs and receivers who get past the linebackers and cornerbacks.
What is the best degree if you wish to become a Drug Rep.? If you are or know a Dug Rep. is would be a plus. I have recruited for this position. You do not need to be a drug rep or a pharmacist. That is silly. Basically all you need is a BS with a concentration in one of the sciences like chemistry or biology. A business degreee with a minor in one of the sciences is fantastic. \nRemember, a drug rep is a sales person. You need general knowledge of the field but the company will provide training on the specifics of what you will be representing in the field.

A question about the last days? Supposedly Nosradamus (I think thats spelt right?!) predicted the end of the world on 06/06/06 my mums a born again christian and says that no-one knows when this will be, only God.\nWhat do you reackon? God does tell his through his word that "no man knows the day nor the hour."  Because of this, we should live our life as if Jesus were to return today.  Even if Jesus doesn't return today, you never know when he may call you home.  Life is taken to much for granted, it can be taken away in a blink of an eye.  If that were to happen, are you ready?

Love is one of the most reconized entities that cant be seen with the eye. Its there but you cant see it. When you have a feeling for a person that takes over every possible thing in the worlds importance but that, LOVE. Nothing else matters in the world but that feeling for a person, LOVE. Love is a chemical release in the brain that tells you "more!" Love is a natural high, drug and emotion.

Are men and women  vitamins the same?

If they have a general label then they can be taken by men or women.
Research paper? I need to write a research paper for one of my classes but i really dont have a topic yet. Any ideas? I recently did a research paper on the explosive economic growth of China and how they're letting it ruin their environment.  It's an interesting topic.  Their population and life expectancy has skyrocketed too.  Did you know that the average life expectancy in 1949 was only 35 years?  Today it's approaching 80.  You could just focus on how China's economy has doubled in 20 years, or you could relate that to their poor polution control practices.

He is a kind, gentle man who has a heart of gold and i love him like a brother - also would i be classed as a sinner for not only being his friend, but living with him and loving him????? I am gay and the priest in my local parish accepts me. Probably because my dad sings in the church choir. Churcher better accept gay man, considering they make up a good part of new priests...\n\nAnd no, you would not be classified as a sinner because you are loving your neighbour, which is truly wonderful.

a person who mentaly multi tasks, diagnosed as such. how can they survive in a normal thinking world? few people truly multi task, most switch between tasks. those who really multi task have difficulty surviving in a single task world. people think they are retarded or worse. if asked to say the alphabet, they would say "a" then "z". most people will say "a-b-c--all the way to z". some true multi task people have had their children taken by the state because no one understands them or how their brain works. where can one find documentation to assist with understanding. If, when asked to recite the alphabet, one says "a" followed by "z" and then stops, that person has not multi-tasked because the task has not been completed regardless of sequencing issues.  Multi-tasking only occurs when the given task is executed to completion.  Either your example is flawed or the assumption of multi-tasking is flawed.\n\nIn computing, multi-tasking requires a minimum of 3 processes: two processes that share the assigned work and one that supervises the functional tasks to insure that they are performed in sequence (and sequencing does matter) and monitors for completion of tasks A and B.  These processes can be assigned to three different CPUs.  While the human brain does have multiple parts, I have not heard of cognition occuring separately in the parts.\n\nIs it possible to think two distinctly different thoughts simultaneously?  My inclination is to say no, the subject is merely jumping from one thought to another and back rapidly - not truly multi-tasking.  Can you cite the basis and origin(s) of the multi-tasking diagnosis?  Would very much like to follow up on this interesting line of thought.
In calculating % error, do you use the smallest division or half the smallest value divided by measurementx100 In calculating % error, do you use the smallest division or half the smallest value divided by measurement x 100\n\n% Error  =  Error \n           _ ___________    x 100\n             Measurement Normally to calculate percent error in statistics, you use the standard deviation. \n \nFor simple math:\n\n% Error = Error x 100\nExample: Given % Error = 75% Then Error = 0.75\n75% = 0.75 x 100\n\nNot totally sure what your exactly asking.

Are we becoming communist? Bushie is letting in millions of illegal aliens every day, and doing nothing about the problem.  They come in here, with their three wives and seventeen kids, rent a two bedroom apartment, and never clean a thing up in their yard.\nwhy should we pay for them.  they come here and collect welfare and foodstamps (don't say they do, i know for a FACT they do.  i worked at the store where ILLEGALS used FOODSTAMPS.\nWe should cut all these programs completely out.  Those who have fifteen welfare babies will soon starve.  good.  quite obviously they're not worth anything anyway if they keep poping out babies just so they can be on welfare.\nI get up and go to work every day just so i can pay taxes and let people live off me for free.  Giving free aid to everyone who sneaks into the country and wants it is DEFINATELY COMMUNIST.  Only a communist would support giving free money away to those who dont' work, and take it away from those who do.  I say, get a job, or starve to death. I say cut welfare. This country was built by HARD working people. Not lazy worthless welfare receptions.
Will spammers win over the spamfighters one day? It seems that for every anti-spam measure there is a new spam method popping up. Will I live to see the day spam is gone - from mail as well as the eb? Spam email will disappear when it is no longer economically feasible for the spammers. As long they can send out a few million spam emails and make a couple of million dollars on that they will continue to do it.  SO the answer lies with people who receive the spam email NEVER responding to or buying anything from a spam email they have received. It's not the spammers' fault that these spam emails keep coming; it's the fault of the people who receive them and respond with wads of cash.\n\nThis is the same reason why prostitution is still going strong after thousands of years: there is a market for it that is positively insatiable.
How can exercise, medication and disease change our heart rate?   excercise eventually decreases the heart rate because the heart gets better conditioned and pumps more efficiently.  Certain medications decrease the heart rate by blocking the stimulation areas of the heart (beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers).  other medicines stimulate the heart and make it beat faster.  Disease can increase the heart rate if it makes the heart have to work harder to pump the blood around, or decrease it if it's things like a heart attack (affecting the heart rate generating area, or the path of the signal) or some electrolyte distrubaces or over medication.
What do i do for this girl who might be asking me out? My neighbors cousin is around my age (14) and she would be okay to go out with. My neighbor had a birthday party and she was over. I went outside to play basketball and they came to play with me. She was playing with me and we were just having fun until like 10:00 when they had to leave. Then i went on a trip to Washington for a week.  The day i came back my other neighbor who lives down the street and was playing basketball with us too came up to me and said that my neighbors cousin liked me and she wanted to know if i wanted to go out with her. I'm not sure if she is telling the truth about it or not. (She has a tendency to lie a lot) I don't know what i should do in the situation\n\nplz help Do you want to date her?  If so and she doesn't have a boyfriend, just ask her.  What have you got to lose?
Write a paragraph or a short story using the words frugal,discreet,imaginary,prominent and instead.?   The other day I was shopping downtown with my imaginary friend Margaret. We have a lot of fun together, but she is quite frugal, which is awkward when I want to buy something extravagant. Take my prom, for example. Margaret and I had to find dresses to wear so we could be beautiful, but instead of going to the department store everyone else goes to, Margaret demanded we go to a thrift store. After an hour or so, I decided I needed to get out of there before all the good dresses at the other shops were gone. Discreet as can be, I slipped out of the dressing room and ran.
What are torrents ? and how legal it is ? Is it not like p2p sharing ? What are torrents ? and how legal it is ? Is it not like p2p sharing ? Torrent are like p2p sharing with one difference. Instead of searching fro other peoples computers you search for torrents which are files containing data of where on the internet the file is stored. It is legal as long as you don't download copyrighted software. To use torrent you'll first need to download and install a client, which is similar to the programs used in p2p. I use azureus, which you can download here:\n\nhttp://www.download.com/Azureus-BitTorrent-Client/3000-2196_4-10530216.html?tag=lst-0-1\n\nWhen that's installed visit sites like:\n\nhttp://www.torrentspy.com/\nhttp://thepiratebay.org/\n\nYou then search for what you want to download. Download and open the torrent with azureus and the file will automatically begin to download.\n\nHope this Helps!
what is kappa number in pulp manufacture ?what does residual alkali signify in spent liquor ?   Kappa number measures the delignification of the pulp.  Pulp will be at a reference Kappa between 60 and 100 usually, depending on the product.  \n\nResidual alkalai is simply the amount of equivalent sodium hydroxide left in the pulp at the point it is measured.  This can be used to predict how much further deliginification can take place.

What is the best diet out there, for obesity?   The best way to lose weight is through a balance of proper nutrition and exercise.  Its an easy formula and most people know it but let me briefly restate.  If you burn more calories than you eat then you will burn off excess fat.\n\nNow, saying it is one thing, the real challenge is doing it.  It would be nice if there was a quick fix but there isn't.  The good news is that changing your lifestyle is nowhere near as boring or as painful as people think.\n\nPlease don't go on a diet, they simply don't work.  The very idea of depriving yourself of food for a limited period and then returning to your 'normal' lifestyle doesn't work no matter how much people talk about it.\n\nEat everything you like but slowly decrease the amount and slowly substitute healthier foods.  Tastes change and I now actually like things that I never thought I would.\n\nI've been an exercise consultant and people often ask me: 'Whats the best kind of exercise?' and I often tell them: 'The best kind of exercise is one that you will do.'\n\nThere is no best exercise or best diet.  The best exercise is any exercise that you like and that fits your daily schedule.  The best diet is to eat things you like but slowly evolve towards healthier choices.\n\nBe patient.  Be determined.  Enjoy.  Good Luck.
Question for  woman only!!? I'm a bi female, i'm seeing a man and a woman. When I'm with a man I usally have an orgasm when I'm on top. My girlfriend does a excellent job orally, but I can't have a orgasm. I tell her it's me not her, I guess i'm not use to it, never had a orgasm orally, but with her she does everthing right and I can't come. Why? What should I do? I get fustrated with myself, and she is so patient. You should have her try inserting her fingers into you to stimulate your G spot while she pleases you orally.  This is probably the little extra you need.  Also, if that doesn't work, they do sell the part of the anatomy she is missing in a double header, you could try that.
Why are blacks so much stronger then other races? Not all blacks but a large lump sum of them are stronger. Blacks went threw slavery and they were reproduced with the strongest male and the stongest female. Do you belive this could have an effect on how black people are today. I was told some blacks have 3 more muscles then the average person because of this. Does anyone belive this or have any idea about anything dealing with this? Its genetic, different races have different traits.  Blacks are taller than whites, they have lower body fat % and are more athletic.  Certain characteristics are genetic, and others are just society.  Asians are intelligent, its hard to say whether or not this is because they are born with bigger brains, or education is just more emphases in their families.  Someone should do a study that charts how someone of different racial back round goes through life when being raised in a different culture.  If an Asian boy was raised by a black family, would he still do excel in school? Or would he be more athletic?  Its hard to say, but as far a physical attributes go, cultures are made different to adapt to their environment.  It doesn't matter if you believe in evolution or not, black people have dark skin for a reason, its hot as hell where they are from, and the sun is scorching.  this could go on forever, but i hope this helps kind of answer your question.

Wife seems confused to me? Needs to be alone to figure things out? Needs to see if she misses me!? My wife of 15 years seems confused to me! She told her sister she doesn't know why she feels the way she does, because I'm a great guy a good provider and a good father. However she says she's lost her love for me. For the last 3-4 years we've given all our time to the kids and forgotten each other. She told me that she felt unloved and alone in the relationship and that now she needs to be alone to figure things out. Could she be overwhelmed with everything, she works two jobs was going to school and all the house work cause I didn't help much plus the kids... Could she be going to some kind of crisis? Is there anyway I can get her back and save our marriage?\n\nWe have 2 kids 10 and 8 years old, she says she knows she is destroying my life the kids life but that she still needs to be alone. She also said that if she starts to miss me that this could be a good sign! How could she not miss me for the last 15 years we've done everything together with the kids! seems like the two of you have grown apart, you need to dedicate time to each other, go on dates, reconnect without the expectations and responsibilities you currently live with...counseling may help...but be prepared, you simply may have fallen out of love...good luck

can u solve this math problem? please help? solve 2sinX=1-2cosX in the interval [ 0 , 2pi) please help! Working in degrees\n\nUse the equivalence sin(x) + cos(x) = sqrt(2) * sin(x + 45)\n\nYou have 2 * sin(x) = 1 - 2 * cos(x)\nRearrange and divide by 2: sin(x) + cos(x) = 1/2\nThen sqrt(2) * sin(x + 45) = (1/2)\nand thus sin(x + 45) = (1/2) / sqrt(2)\n\nAfter that it boils down to calculator bashing\n\n(1/2) / sqrt(2) = 0.3536\nx + 45 = 20.71 (degrees)\nx = 335.7 degrees\n\nI'll leave you to sort out whether there are other solutions.

Should I accept this guy's love or not? Please help.? I know this guy for about 3 months now. We have gonne out 6-7 times but just like friends. This last time he told me that he doesn't see me just like a friend, but that he feels something for me and that he wants me to be his girlfriend.\nI don't know what to do because there are some problems:\n1.We work in the same place and I don't like this.\n2. He is 1 year younger than me.\n3 And the 3rd I think he is too young (23 years old) to want smth serious, whereas I want smth serious.\nI like him very much, but I'm not sure about this.\nPlease help. What should I do???????????? Strange Question. But Simple answer. You know about him only 3 Months. Please take some more time to know about him personally. You were working with him. This is a good chance to know about him more. Just have a look around him, like How he interacts with other workers? If you feel good, Go along with him. \n=> Working in same place.\nYou raise this question directly to him. Let him to say his opinion. If you like his reason then, he goes well. You can understand his thinking/knowledge when you raise it to him. \n=> Younger\nIt is just one year. So, never mind. Basically, Girls will have a less period time(Sexual Periods). But Guys will have long period. To compensate that,  a guy have to marry elder girl to him. Its not at all followed today. Since, Most of them are not interested in sex after one or two decade. After that they are fully interested to think in real love.\nSo, Don't worry about the age. (And your case you are 100% Eligible)\n==>Too Young.\nThis is another Good point. You are having years. This time you could know him fully. You could understand his real love by his patience. If he fails, you could ignore him easily. You just ask him to achieve more. \n==> You love him:\nGood. Congrats for you both. Have a better thinking before moving further.
who likes the yankees besides me?   I like them, but they're in trouble.

anyone who knows about evolution will love this question!? an example of Darwins theorie is, let's say there is one specis of monkey, with 2 types, and one is tall, and the other short. the tall ones, whenever they try to swing in the trees, they hit there head and die. which means that all the tall ones will die and take themselfs out of the gene pool, thus creating a specis of short monkeys. But, in todays modern societey, humans would stop evolving because we are the dominent specis and do not let our kind die that easily, makeing our gene pool very large.So, my point is,there is no danger of eliminating genes from our gene pool because there isn't one gene that is needed for survival, nor is there one gene that if anyone had it, it would cause them to die.\nSo are we going to stay like this forever? according to scientists that preach the THEORY of evolution. we evolved from other animals that evolved from single celled organisms that evolved from a puddle of goo that contained the building blocks of life. problem is that the puddle of goo either came from dissolving rocks or a form of acid rain caused by the volcanoes of the time period.\nso basically scientists believe we evolved from rocks or magma.\n\ni think the idea That we were Created by God much more logical. considering the order thoughout the universe.

Why do a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law have very angry relations? If you watch daily soaps, let it be hindi or in english,there is a arguement between both of them.Why Often because sons/husbands inadvertently put them in opposing situations by not letting go of "dear old mom" and putting their wives first as they should.  I have a wonderful relationship with my daughter-in-law, but I'm fortunate in that she's a sweet girl who loves my son very much.  Because that's true, I make it a point to keep the boundaries very clear.  \n\nHowever, those boundaries can become much more difficult to maintain, I imagine, if one's child is married to someone who doesn't love or appreciate him/her, or who treats him/her poorly.  Mothers tend to be protective of their children, and that can complicate in-law relations if they become too aware of and too involved in their children's marriages.  If my son and his wife argue, I don't want to know about it--I encourage him to talk to a friend, or his brother, or even better--to his wife.\n\nThe soaps, though, are an entirely different story--they dramatize and emphasize the conflicts that people encounter in their lives, which is what makes watching them entertaining.  No matter how bad you think you've got it, odds are good that your favorite soap character has it worse! ;)
what do you mean by the term pre alert? it is related to the field of logistics Pre-alert is a means of notifying importer about his goods arriving. Say, You are importer in US and expect shipment to arrive for you from Indonesia. You ask your shipping company/customs broker/ import clearance broker to give you a pre-alert on arriving shipments. They'll usually notify you thrre-four days before the shipment arrives, so that you are able to prepare all customs documents for customs clearance.\n\nHope this helps.\nGood luck.

Is it normal to sell rights to pollute? Do you think that it is normal that a company (or a country)could buy the right to pollute the earth ? It does sound odd, but here is an example:\n\n"The 1990 Clean Air Act allows the EPA to grant "emissions permits" for certain pollutants. These are, in effect, rights to pollute that can be traded among polluters. Imagine a giant bubble that encloses all existing sources of air pollution. Within that bubble some emitters may pollute over the control level as long as other polluters compensate by polluting less. The government or some other authority decides on the desired level of pollution and the initial distribution of pollution rights within an industry or for a geographic region—the "bubble" that encloses these sources. Purchases and sales of permits within the "bubble" should reduce the total level of pollution to the allowable limit at the lowest total cost. \n\nFor example, a St. Louis study found that the cost of reducing particulate emissions for a paper-products factory was $4 per ton, while the cost to a brewery was $600 per ton. The Clean Air Act could require St. Louis to reduce its emissions by a certain amount. Under the traditional approach, the brewery and the paper factory would each be required to cut emissions by, say, ten tons. The cost to the paper factory would be only $40, while the cost to the brewery would be $6,000. But with tradable permits, the brewery could pay the paper factory to cut emissions by twenty tons so that the brewery could continue to operate without reducing emissions at all. The net result is the same emission reduction of twenty tons as under the command-and-control approach, but the total cost to society of the reduction is only $80 instead of $6,040."

Ladies what do you think of single women who mess with other men? My sister's friends now has total disrespect for her mother and the man that her mother is messing with.  And she says that her mother is very able to finanically support herself and as been for thirteen years, and she says she knows for a fact her mother is not in love.  And she knows her mother would mess with another married man if she wanted to.  What do you think of her mother and women like her and what should my sister's friend do? well there is really nothing your friend can "do". Her mother is an adult and free to make her own choices, whether they are good ones or not. Her mother obviously has committment issues and as long as she is involved with married men that takes care of that. If it was my mother, I wouldn't be happy about it, but I could never disrespect her and I would ALWAYS love her regardless.

Sun exposure warnings with Zyrtec? I have broken out with a rash that may be sun poisoning. I was only out in the sun for an hour today around 10 am.  I have been on zytec for several months and never experienced this problem.  Any ideas? Once i got a prescription filled for Zyrtec and there was a sticker on it about sun exposure. I asked the dr. and he said he hadn't heard anything about it. but i guess there is something to it.

best nutrition for lymphedema? I have lymphedema in both arms, and some days are better than others. Is it aggravated by something I'm eating? Introduction\n\nThere is no special diet that will prevent or control lymphedema; however, good nutrition promotes good health and this helps the body manage with the stresses related to lymphedema. When other conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes, are present the diet must be adjusted to accommodate the specialized needs of these conditions.\n\nDietary Protein\n\nSince the fluid associated with lymphedema is protein-rich a question that often arises is, “Should I stop eating protein so there won’t be protein in this fluid?” The answer to this question is, “No! Do not stop eating protein. It won’t solve your problem because proteins are essential nutrients.”\n\nDietary proteins are present in the foods we eat and are important to good health because:\n# Proteins are the building blocks of the body.\n# Proteins are the only nutrients that can repair worn-out tissue and build new ones.\n# Proteins are used by the body in manufacturing hormones.\n# Proteins have a role in building antibodies to fight infections.\n# Proteins aid the blood in transporting oxygen and nutrients.\n# Proteins are essential to the clotting of blood.\n\nWhen There is a Shortage of Dietary Proteins\n\nThe goal for each individual should be to eat the appropriate amount of dietary protein to meet nutritional needs. This protein should come from a variety of sources, not only meat, and include only a minimum of fat.\n\nWhen there are not enough dietary proteins available to meet the daily needs of the body, proteins are taken from the tissues and muscles to maintain the proper protein level of the blood. A severe shortage of dietary proteins will weaken connective tissues and causes them to swell. This is known as hunger edema and it can be seen in the swollen bellies of starving children.\n\nSeriously restricting the intake of dietary protein in an effort to control the swelling of lymphedema does not help. It has just the opposite effect: It increases the amount of swelling that is present. It also weakens the muscles and other tissues.\n\nStaying Hydrated\n\nThe term hydrated describes the state of having adequate fluids in the body. Maintaining this state helps the body remove impurities from the blood and this is important to good health.\n\nDrinking plenty of fluids, particularly water, is essential to maintaining this balance within the body. Cutting back on fluid intake in an effort to reduce the swelling of lymphedema doesn’t work! Instead of the desired effect, the protein-rich lymph of lymphedema attracts more fluid from the other parts of the body. This can cause increased swelling in the affected area.\n\nDrinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day is recommended to maintain good health; however this need increases in hot weather, or in very dry conditions, when the body looses fluids more rapidly.\n\nBeing well hydrated, by drinking plenty of water, is particularly important after an MLD or pump treatment because it is necessary to flush out the impurities that were moved during treatment.\n\nCaffeine, which is a mild diuretic, reduces the level of body fluids by encouraging the kidneys to excrete more urine. For this reason caffeine containing substances (coffee, tea, chocolate and many soft drinks) should be consumed only in moderation.\n\nAlcohol also has a diuretic effect that stimulates the kidneys to excrete more water and thereby increasing dehydration.\n\nEating a Balanced Diet\n\nEating a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits and vegetables is recommended for maintaining good general health. It also aids the body in coping with the added stress caused by lymphedema.\n\nHigh salt foods, which encourage the body to retain fluids, are not part of a recommended healthy diet.\n\nMaintaining Normal Weight\n\nMaintaining the normal weight for your height and age is also an important part of managing lymphedema. The mechanism of how excess fat interacts with the development of lymphedema is not yet clear

Books on brain? I had finished my 10th std(16 years).I would like to be nuerosurgeon.I would like to accept your advise on books on this topic so that i could improve my knowledge.P.S.the book must be understandable and up to my level. Hey! I am a neurosurgeon, and it's... well, it's really fun. Assuming you like that sort of thing. Which I do. :)\n\nThere are different sorts of books out there, and I have a few recommendations:\n\n- BEST place to start: Women in Neurological Surgery (WINS) produces a pamphlet called "So You Want to Be a Neurosurgeon" which details everything you need to know about becoming a neurosurgeon. Link is below.\n\n- "Principles of Neural Science" by Kandel and Schwarz is a good basic neuroscience textbook, now in its 3rd edition, that you will end up using if you take almost *any* neuroscience courses in university. It may be a bit above your level at the moment but it is a good basic read, especially the first chapters.\n\n- "Complications" by Atul Gawande is not specifically a neurosurgical book, but it is a really excellent collection of essays about some of the ethical and moral issues of medicine and surgery, particularly with regards to training. It is a fascinating read, and was written by a general surgical trainee.\n\n- "When The Air Hits Your Brain" by Frank Vertosick is an interesting peek into the life of a neurosurgery resident. Having been through residency myself, I can say this is pretty true-to-life, and covers the tough bits, the funny bits, and the heart-breaking bits. It does contain a fair bit of profanity. But then, so does your average surgical residency program, sadly! :)\n\n- "The Healing Blade" talks about the work of Robert Spetzler, a very famous vascular neurosurgeon (does aneurysms, etc.) still practicing at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Texas.\n\n- there is also lots of good, easily understandable information about neurosurgical disease available on websites like Brain Injury Support, Brain Tumour Foundation, etc.\n\n- www.neurosurgery.org is a fun place to poke around.\n\nFinally, if you want to message with any specific questions, feel free. Good luck - it's a long road, but it really is a great, highly rewarding career.

What causes the sound we hear when our neck or knucles crack?   That sound is created by pockets of air in your joints popping.  Those air pockets are created by your everyday movements.\n\nIt's not actually as bad for you as people like to say except for the strain it sometimes puts on ligaments.
I have swollen Lymph Nodes under my arm, how can I ease the pain ? I just started taking antibotics today , but under my arm is so swollen the pain is constant.  Have tried hot compresses, black drawing salve , etc.. but nothing is helping.  Any ideas on how to relieve the pain ?  Thanks Sweetie?  Swollen lymph nodes are very serious.  You didn't say what the underlying problem is.  You need to go back to your doctor and ask for pain medication if it is that serious.  I am truly frightened for you because a lot of very serious illnesses are the primary cause of swollen lymph nodes.  Can you give us the skinny on the primary cause?  Go back to the doctor.  Please?  Keep me updated.  E-mail me, okay?  I care.  My Mom died because she waited for the last symptom of her illness (breast cancer) to arise, which was terribly painful lymph nodes in her armpits.  I am not trying to scare you.  Go back to the doctor.  NOW!

I was wondering if conservatives could actually conduct an educated conversation with a liberal without the? petty name calling?\nI have some conservative friends and we get along just fine.Because believe it or not,there are some things we agree on. Personally I think people have more in common than they may think.  It's stupid to attach yourself to a label because of a few hot topic issues.  I think most of America is moderate.  The idiots on the far ends of both sides get the most attention.  I think that neither the very Conservative Republicans, or the very Liberal Democrats represent a majority of America.  I could give a crap about Gay Marriage and Abortion, but people on both sides of the issue put that ahead of health care and education and so on.  The things that truly matter take a back seat to issues that only affect a minority of Americans.
Is anyone else offended by the way Memorial Day is used? We are supposed to be reflecting on those who have given the last full measure of devotion for this country.\n\nEverywhere I turn there are adds for the "Great Memorial Day Sale" without even a mention of what it is BESIDE a great day for great values.\n\nI drive down the street on Memorial Day (or Veteran's day or 4th of July) and I don't see flags out anymore.\n\nI am just curious because none of the days mentioned or the flying of the flag is owned by any political party or anything like that.  So, are you offended by it and do you know WHY people stopped caring?  (AND PLEASE, NO POLITICAL RHETORIC - NIETHER PARTY IS TO BLAME FOR THIS). well it's like chirsmas and Easter.Everyone found a new reason to have holidays. We forgot the value of our holidays. We gave up in beleaveing.
When trying to access anon. proxy servers from work/school, I am now getting a msg. that it is blocked as well Is there something I can try to get through this also?If you have links, please include.  \nP.S.  I am a total novice...think easy step by step!  Thanks! There are reasons that these are blocked at your "work/school".  My guess is it is at school and you want to get out to play games without being caught by the Internet filters.  These applications are put in place to protect not just the "worker/student" but also the "workplace/school".  Even through Anon. proxy sites your NAT IP address can be traced back to the originating location and you then make that place liable for anything that you do.\n\nAfter your email:\nTry this:\nOpen Internet explorer.\nTools|Internet Options|Connections\nclick the LAN Settings button\nSelect the Proxy Server check box.\nEnter this IP: 209.128.101.244\nClick OK until Closed.\n\nNow your IE will let by-pass the filters.
Why can't I make female friends? as soon as they find out what I do for a living, females are no longer interested in talking to me. Forget their boyfriend's too. They are usually forbidden to speak to me. Gee! This is really tough to figure out. Why would a female expose her boyfriend to a sexy exotic dancer with all the connotations that go with that lifestyle?\n\nI don't know, You've got me. I guess maybe because of the temptation that would be present. Do you think that might have something to do with it?

how do you cure horrible headaches and migrains? I get these awful migrains everyday and I have no idea how to cure them.any ideas? I would suggest seeing a family physician.  I have had months on end of headaches.  I have tried migraine medication that didn't work.  Eventually a neurologist had commented that mine are from neck and shoulder tension.  Using too many pills over time can make headaches worse.  Try looking at medical websites to determine if you are suffering from migraines or tension headaches.  Once you figure that out, it is easier to learn how how to treat them.  Hope it isn't migraine because some of the medication is awfully expensive ($100 for 6 pills).  Because headaches can be a sign of brain tumors, it isn't something you want to take lightly.  Don't wait.
At Yale, why did the CIA want to take the Nathan Hale statue? Yale refused to give it to them I cannot say for sure, but it appears that the statue at Yale University is the original sculpture.  The other locations, including CIA have replicas.  My guess is that the CIA wanted the original - but Yale has no motivation to part with that bit of history.\n\nFrom first link:\nA statue of Hale, sculpted around 1898 by Bela Lyon Pratt, was cast in 1912 and stands in front of Connecticut Hall at Hale's alma mater, Yale. Copies of this sculpture stand at the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts; the Nathan Hale Homestead; the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.; and at the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nFrom CIA tour (second link):\n\nOne of three sculptures on the grounds, this statue is a replica of the original work created in 1914 for Yale University, Nathan Hale's alma mater, by Bela Lyon Pratt. The Agency's copy of the statue was erected on the grounds in 1973, 200 years after his graduation from Yale.
What is going to happen to your soul after you die?   In Genesis when God created Adam he became a living soul.(Gen.2:7)Also,throughout the Bible,animals are called souls.\nThe soul is not immortal--that is a false teaching that is found nowhere in the Scriptures.At ezekial 18:4 it tells us that "the soul that is sinning,it shall die." In the book of Acts it tells us: "And it shall come to pass,that every soul which will not hear the Prophet,shall be destroyed from among the people." (Acts 3:23)\nWhen a soul(person) dies,they return to the dust ,awaiting a resurrection to either life in heaven or to life on a paradise earth.

Vibrio is a type of comma (',') shaped bacteria, which has one or more flagella."Vibrio" is the generic name, i.e. a Genus under kingdom Monera. the most common example is the Vibrio cholerae, that are present in filthy water and causes the disease cholera when ingested.
For someone you loved so long shouldnt like you for your looks right? I heard the only reason he first started liking me was becuz he thought i was pretty then i started talkin to him n stuf he asked me out and yeah it went on.\nSo im afaid i have short hair and shit and  i dont like it i think i look like a dude =/\nWell he still love me back or he will find someone better?\nIts just hair like in 2 months my hair will be back to normal\nright? The Looks isn't always supposed tobe the fact that makes a person loveable. It's simply a materialistic value or a first impression. You may understand that certain feelings, like understanding each other, has tobe more advanced with time. That's true love! \n\nIf he rejected you for your looks this means, he didn't simply love you, but he had lust on you. Its much different. Ask him, whether he had any misunderstandings lately. Anyone, anything said or happenned wrong? It could be a very simple thing. Try to mend the thing, or get ready to dump him. Its always upto you. Things always have a "Wind-of-Change" if it wasn't for good.\nBye,

what is the prospect of metastatic carcinoma axilary lymph nods?   If I understand you, you are asking, what are the chances that  a carcinoma of the axillary lymph nodes will metastasize...well, with all lymph cancers metastasis is a likelihood, but if it is yet early in the development of the disease treatment can still be affected. Remember, even if it does metastasize, modern medicine is marvelous and it's better to be down a few nodes than it is to be down a few dozen years.

can two opposite sex become a good friends? I always end up with most of my male friends misunderstanding me that i have a crush on them. I didn't treart any of them special. I treat them as I treat others. If I kind to one of them, that's mean I kind to rest of them too. But they always think that I like them; so when I make a distance from them, they always end up to have a conclusion I just toying them.\nHow can I avoind such things happen again? actually, many of my closest friends are male. yeah, sometimes they do expect more from me then what they are going to get. but i would just flat out tell them that you aren't interested in that.\nalso make sure that your kindness can't be mistaken as flirting. its a fine line, but it is there.

why is their so much tragedy in our world? IS IT BECAUSE WE HAVE CHOSEN WRONG LEADERS OF OUR TIME,\nTHAT HAS CAUSED DEATH AND MISERY AROUND THE WORLD AND \nHAVE NO HUMAN VALUE. I don't think we are able to pin point a specific reason why.  Even though I hate Bush and everything he stands for, I can't blame him for everything that happens, but I will blame him for everything and anything that has to do with the government, like help to Katrina victims, Sept 11th, the war in Iraq, the deficit spending, social security's bankruptcy... things of that nature.  But there some even worst things happening like natural disasters killing hundreds of thousands that you just can't blame on anybody.  I guess these are the times we're living in and we should pick leaders who are apt and know how to handle such conflict and tragedy.

"For those a little older"(and the ocassional smartass)Do you remember? Do you remember the Singer and the song "Frog Kissing"\n(Hey I'm just being nice and returning points to those who have let me earn points.But I don't wanta make it easy) Hmmm...recorded by Chet Atkins...during my time...about 30 years ago but not my kind of song.\n\nFrog Kissin'\n\n\nDo you remember in the fairy tale, how the wicked witches spell\nTurned the handsome prince to a toad?\nBy the power of a potion, she handed him the notion\nHe was lower than the dirt in the road.\nAnd though she left him green and warted, her evil plans were thwarted\nTheir chanced to happen by a young miss\nWho inspite of his complexion, offered him affection\nAnd broke the wicked curse with her kiss \n\n\nSo if you've never been frog kissing\nThen you don't know what you've been missin',\nThere's a wealth of opportunity under each and every log.\nAnd if you've never been charm-breakin',\nThen you've never been handsome prince makin'.\nYou've got to slow down, turn around, bend down, \nKiss you a frog!\n\nOnce upon a time ago, I was down and feelin' low\nLike a lonely frog in a pond\nMy life was just a joke, and I was just about to croak\nCuz I'd be zapped by life's wicked wand.\nBut in the depths of my depression, there came a true expression\nOf love from a person so sweet.\nShe gave me warm fuzzy feelings, feelings that were healin'\nAnd she knocked me off my little webbed feet.\n\nThere's a happy-ever-after-land, deep in the heart of man\nWhere a prince and princess abides.\nBut all we get are glimpses, of the happy prince or princess\n'Cauce they're covered with a green warty hide.\nThough they're full of life's potential, they're lacking one essential\nTo enable them to shine like a star.\nThat's a handsome guy or missus, to smother them with kisses\nAnd love them just the way that they are.\n\nThat's the secret of frog kissing\nYou can do it too if you'll just listen\nThere's a wealth of opportunity under each and every log.\nThat's the secret of charm-breakin',\nThat's the secret of handsome prince makin'.\nYou've got to slow down, turn around, bend down, \nKiss you a...\nYou've got to slow down, turn around, bend down, \nKiss you a...\nYou've got to slow down, turn around, bend down, \nKiss you a frog!
I am 14 and I have a crush on this guy at school. We're friends and all but I don't know if he likes me back. Some people say I need a boyfriend.

Can anyone help? hang out with your group every day but spend extra time with him. soon he might consider you as a friend. then make your move and talk to him about how you feel.since you talk to him a lot you might be able to do it by your self. if your to nervous have a close friend do it for you(preferably a girl because teling his friend might make him embarresd)if he says no at first it might be awkward to talk to him .dont worry just ease into it. if he says maybe let him take his time. if he says yes your good to go!
Is England Scotland and Wales actually seperate countries in a sense but part of the larger United Kingdom? It gets somewhat confusing,,especially when you ask someone where they are traveling to they typically say England,,or Scotland,,not the United Kingdom. Yes they are separate countries but under the same state administration (although with, to different degrees, their own assemblies).  Scotland is unique in having its own legal system.  There is free movement between these countries ... all hold UK passports.\n\nIt is no more complicated than me saying I am going to Florida or Texas on holiday rather than just America.\n\nHoe that helps but if you need more drop me a note.

what are the kinds of  viruses out there, how do they get in your computer, and where they come from? Really need help on this please. Also can you get viruses from messenger or in some sites like asian west. \n\nThanks a lot for your answers. Types of virus\nFrom worms to macros, there's a whole host of viruses out there to catch...\n\nWorms\nThese viruses spread via computer networks. The ILOVEYOU virus above was a classic example of a worm. These viruses are becoming an increasing threat as a growing number of computers are permanently connected to networks. Worms can spread over corporate networks or via emails sent over the Internet.\n\nTrojans\nA Trojan virus takes its name from a story in Homer's Iliad where Greek soldiers pretended to make peace with their enemies, the Trojans. The Greeks made a grand peace-keeping gesture - the gift of a large wooden horse.\n\nWhen the Trojans hauled it inside their city gates, a small band of Greek warriors leapt out. They opened the gates and let the rest of the Greek army storm in to capture the city.\n\nA Trojan virus is one that opens your computer up to malicious intruders, allowing them to read your files.\n\nFile viruses\nA file virus is one that replaces a key system file on your computer. These viruses can reload themselves every time you start your computer up. Once they're in the memory, they can spread by writing themselves to any disk you insert into your disk drive.\n\nBoot sector viruses\nThis is an early type of computer virus that spreads by hiding itself in an invisible location on your hard drive or floppy disk. When your computer reads an infected floppy disk, the virus is copied from the disk to your computer's memory.\n\nFrom there, it writes itself to the 'boot sector' on your hard drive. The boot sector is read each time you turn your computer on. So the virus is constantly reloaded and can copy itself on to other floppy disks. These viruses are fairly rare nowadays, as they are easy to catch.\n\nMacroviruses\nA macrovirus infects word processor files, such as Microsoft Word documents. Although not as dangerous as other viruses, they can spread quickly if a Word file is sent via email. After an initial scare, Microsoft added protection into later versions of Word, so you receive a warning about infected documents.\n\nHoaxes\nThe virus hoax came about after friends sent each other emails about a new virus threat. Someone decided that they could cause just as much trouble by sending out fake warnings rather than real viruses.\n\nHoaxes may seem harmless, but they do a great deal of damage to the Internet as a whole. Not only do they slow down traffic and clog up email servers, but they also cause people to panic. Companies can spend money and time investigating what is just someone's idea of a joke.\n\nMobile phone viruses\n\nAlthough rare, mobile phones are the latest technology to be hit by virus problems. Some people have discovered that it is possible to crash certain types of mobile by sending them a coded text message.\n\n\nfollow links for more info

What are the rules for an onside kick?   On an onside kick the kicking team usually floods most of it's players to one side of the field in hopes of recovering the kick. The ball must travel 10 yards before the kicking team can recover the kick unless it first touches an opposing player. Once the ball has traveled 10 yards or has been touched by the opposing team it is a free ball for anyone to recover.
This week, Senate Republicans suggested that $100 rebate checks should be sent to millions of taxpayers? This week, Senate Republicans suggested that $100 rebate checks should be sent to millions of taxpayers to help drivers cope with the cost of gasoline. A Democrat is also leading a campaign for a 60-day gasoline tax holiday. Which option do you favor? \n\n** $100 rebate check?\n** 60-day gasoline tax holiday? Neither, both are faulty economics addressing a media hype not event. Gas cost 3 times what it did in 1979. People are making 3 times what they did in 1979. Why is this an issue? Because the press says it is.

Is it true? When you really like someone and they keep blowing you off like they dont care, if you start to act like you dont care, they will be all over you? Sometimes,yes.Nature of people: they seem to realise how much some person means to them when they lose her.When they lose her,they realise what mistakes have been made.\n\nThe other posibility is that they to that because they just don't want to show their feelings.So,they blow you off in hope that you will want them more than ever.People aren't so perfect,as you can see...

So many hot american babes in yahoo land, where are the aussies? I dont mind american chicks. I love them. Their accents are up there with the British in terms of how hot it is for an Aussie like me.

I agree......! \nAustralian (and New Zealanders) of both sexes can be so gorgeous !!!\nI think they don't take themselves as seriously nor feel desperate like the US people do..they are more humble, down to earth, funny...love the Australians..Worked with several : men and women : gorgeous people on the outside and inside but "not the flashy type"..\n\n*No "dating" potential...I should say.....just friends !

I need money to pay my house note, my husband has been laid off  over a year.?   The key to financial well being is looking ahead with the right attitude.  If your hubby has been looking for a year, he probably feels like dog poop and so do you.  There is no magic solution, but you might think of selling your house and moving to an apartment, relocating to a different place or starting your own business.  Your real key to a real solution is motivation and you don't just pick that up off the street. \nFind some professional financial advice first and get some spiritual help, perhaps at your local church.  Get involved in groups.  You find jobs not in the want ads but because someone knows you and recommends you.  Be prepared to make some serious changes.  Better to sell your house and lose some than lose everything to a foreclosure.  Although it seems trite, undergoing hardship can make you stronger.  I became a bartender after being laid off from a high paying job some years ago.  It's inexpensive as education funds go and you get the money back in short order. It was only temporary, but it got the funds coming in again without losing everything. Sit down and go over the positive aspects of both your lives and see what talents you have.  You might just be looking in the wrong place.  God bless you!
thank you note in response to  sympathy basket?   It is appropriate to send a thank you note for all sympathy gifts. That would include plants, flower arrangements, food or  other baskets, checks or cash donations. \nThe note doesn't need to be long. Something along the lines of : "Thank you for sending the (fill in the blank) in my (fill in the blank)'s memory. I was kind of you to remember me during this difficult time. I appreciate it. Sincerely, " would be sufficient. \nThis would let the person know that you received the item they sent, and let them know you appreciated it.
what do you do if you get aids?   If I got aids, first of all, I would try to determine when I contracted it and contact all the people I may have infected. I would do this by retracing my steps so to speak. Go to the last person I put myself at risk with & backtrack until I get to someone who isn't infected & that would give me an idea who I contracted it from. I would still need to contact the people from before that though, just in case someone just got lucky & didn't get it from me. It's not gonna be easy & I would need to be ready for a few black eyes because if someone came to me and told me they may have given me aids I'd be tempted to give them the biggest beating of their entire life. I know it would be hypocritical of me for having put myself at risk but it's just human nature. Other than informing people and making sure I don't infect anyone else, there's not much else I can do. I would just need to make sure I keep myself healthy because the slightest infection would make me very ill.

Do I need to go to medical school to become a Registered Nurse in bachelors? thanks I think you may be mixing things up a bit.\n\nYou can become a Registered Nurse without getting a Bachelors of Science but it is getting harder to find nursing programs that do that.\n\nYou should TRY and get a Bachelor of Science Registered Nursing degree if you can.  I am not a nurse, but I work with a lot of them in a hospital and I see the job postings.  Most job postings are looking for BS RN.  More opportunity for you if you go that route, more advancement, management etc.  BIGGER PAYCHECKS.\n\nBut do not let that stop you, if you can become a Registered Nurse without it then go for it.  You can always get the BS degree later on.\n\nGood luck.
Does Diego Maradona have the hands of God?

Mosquitoes? My husband says that mosquitoes bite only once.  I'm not buying it.  Is this true? No, this is not true.  Mosquitoes are primarily nectar feeder with only the females requiring a blood meal to acquire protein prior to laying eggs.  Female mosquitoes may feed upon many types of animals including mammals, birds, and reptiles.  As a result, individual mosquitoes often serve as disease vectors, transmitting diseases from one host animal to another such as malaria, filariasis, yellow fever, dengue fever, epidemic polyarthritis, Rift Valley fever, and West Nile virus.  In fact, the organisms that cause these diseases have evolved life cycles that take advantage of this method of transmission.\n\nFemale members of the genus Anopheles can survive as adults up to a month in captive breeding and usually a 1-2 weeks in the wild.  During this time, the adult female repeats a cycle of eating a full blood meals then laying eggs every 2-3 days in tropical climates or over a longer time period in cooler climates.  Thus, multiple blood meals and multiple egg laying events.

i like this guy... how should i go about it? i like this guy that just got out of this one year long relationship with this girl that cheated on him (thats why they broke up) and he says he's interesting in me but each time i see him with her they are all over each other (not kissing) what should i do? Mmm well he prolly still has some feelings for her but im pretty sure hes not gonna go back out w. her since he was the one to brake up  in the first place..Soo in my opinion i think u should jsut talk to him more. You know flirt areound a bit. Soo he can see the real you..And totally forget about his cheating ex..As you can see shes trying to win him back and all you can doo is not let that happenen by talkin/flirtin =] It'll work out cause he knows how she is. but he still has to see how u are. Ooolala. Haha
Can God be described by a Mathematical formula - a transformation from physical space to spiritual space? Of course, I am referring to the spiritual space that can be described to confirm with scriptural meaning of God and God's kingdom as well as the explanations of the same by spiritual teachers, prophets and incarnations that have been in existence so far in the history.  I am also thinking of a mathematical formulation because mathematics, to my understanding is absolute representation of the quantifiable physical space just as God's space is understood to be absolute. If possible, the formula could only be understood by Divinity.  It would involve concepts and realizations too far beyond the ability of humanity to understand, just as the concept of a "Unified Whole" is beyond humanity.

Why do swimmers float better in the ocean than they do in freshwater? I need answers ASAP!? PLEASE HELP. Please give details if so, or even the link to a site with the answer works. thank you! #1.When a body floats it displaces fluid (water here) equal in weight to its own weight. \n\n#2.Buoyancy is equal to weight of the fluid displaced\n\nso that we can say for a floating body: \nbuoyancy = weight of the fluid displaced = weight floating body\n\n#3.Sea water density is more  than that of  fresh water, \n\nso a lesser amount of sea water provides the required buoyancy to enable the swimmer float, and less sea water needs to be displaced. \n\nThis makes the job of swimmer easier.\n\n[BTW: A boiled egg floats easily in salty water for the same reason]
How weird is my husband.....? My husband and I have a great, loving relationship.\nSex life is "so-so".\nMy husband will only give ME oral sex....after we have had intercourse. That is the ONLY time he will.\nI've never had a guy do that - let alone do it just about every time we are intimate!\nMy husband was involved with a married woman before he met me - and I guess he gave her oral often after she and the gals husband had sex.\nIs this just a fetish?\nDo other guys do this? \nAny other gals have a husband/boyfriend that does this?\nI would think that would be the last thing a guy would want to do after intercourse. It could just be a fetish of his. Personally, I keep my oral persuasions for *before* penetration, but that's just me.

Of course you can wear your DVDs out....like everything else in this world the DVDs have got a lifecycle as well which according to the SONY web site is between 21 and 27 years depending on how often do you use them, where do you keep them (in terms of environment), is your DVD reader new or old (older readers scratch the discs far more often than new one, if the reader is more than 16-18 months old - consider it as very old one)....there are a DVDs which are called TITANIUM - they have a special cover which protects them.

Your theater teacher should know this stuff or should be bringing someone in who can show you how to do realistic falls without hurting yourself.
How many words a minute is average reading speed for an adult?   We read at an average rate of 240 words (about half a novel page) per minute – our light-material rate. Most people study or read technical material at less than half this rate – about 100 words a minute. So for the average person, reading a 400-page novel will consume about 12 hours and a 400-page text-book will consume about 30 hours.”
please read , question inside? I would like to first say I do believe in the existence of a higher power, something that has created  us, I question religions and interpretations of the bible. Those people that tell me because of my different belief system I will end burning in hell for the eternity ,that is the biggest insult.   What makes me really upset is when they talk about choice,number one  I did not chose to be born, I did not chose life,life was given to me, if I was not born in the fist place I would have to hear about all this nonsense of being punished just because my mind set  is different than theirs. I  have already being punished, I was born with a genetic deformity, who created me? I do not care about life, life might be precious to you , it is not to me. So I am suffering already and I am supposed to be forced to believe in the God of the bible so he will not throw me in the lake of fire, how did I make a choice to be born? how did I make a choice to be born with a  disease? I did I make a choice to be born in the family I was born? easy for the hypocrites to say I chose  LORD as my savior the were not confronted with the challenges I HAVE BEING CONFRONTED WITH, if he your GOD did not put me in this earth in the first place I would NOT have to be tormented by the suffering caused by my disease and by the insults coming from those who tell me , with threats I deserve to go to hell just because I DO NOT BELIVE WHAT THEY DO.  I 'd rather keep a different idea of God not the one that you present to me with your religion and with your interpretation of the Bible , that belief that I hold is the one that keeps me going in my life. You should be ashamed of yourselves to be preaching psychologically harmful things and keep saying but that  GOD that said so, it is YOU THAT SAID SO not GOD. Christianity is not the only way.  To think so is arrogant beyond mere words to describe.  But to address your question regarding the circumstances of your birth, there are many spiritual paths that have a far better grasp of this issue.  Buddhism being one of many.\n\nMight I suggest that you take a look elsewhere?  You might be startled and amazed by the answers and guidance you can receive from other spiritual paths that understand the fundamentals and mechanics of reincarnation.  From that point, you could well handle your personal challenges better and hopefully live a more positive life.  And finally...\n\nWhatever belief system you have that keeps you going under what I can see must be difficult circumstances, Bravo!  Go about your business and life as you see fit and let the fundies stew in their own juices.  It is your life, no matter how it happened, so enjoy it to the best of your ability.

Is there a difference between Radiography program and a Radiologic Program?

A radiograph is the picture you take.\nI know, who really cares....\nBut the people in these programs do care.\nYou can find out a lot about this on the AART website.

Getting hold of someone? I'm in Year 9 and I feel uncomfortable being one in a small crowd of people who hasn't got hold of a girl yet. The thing that puts me down most is one I dont have a girlfriend, and I crave a decent lengthy relationship, and two, if I ever got to the stage where I was to get hold of a girl, what the hell do I do, I'm sure others have this problem, so my question is, how did you handle your first kiss (not just a peck on the lips, I've done all that!), but do you have any tips of just to take it easy and not be totally bad at it, I hope you sort of know what I'm asking, and can give me the sort of answer I need! Look you take your time, find someone you want to be with, don't go for someone just cos your mates are doing it, u'd be letting your principle's down and yourself, and if your mates take the Micky they're not such good mates after all... and as for every thing else you've asked advice on it'll will all come to you naturally i promise.. you seem very cool for your age and you'll figure it out.. when kissing don't have wet lips and for god sake don't stick your tongue down they're throat straight away.. take it slow u'll be great good luck

How would I find jobs in Panama, through American companies? I've heard there are companies that need people to work in Panama, but alot of people dont want to transfer to another country for various reasons.... how would I find these companies and job offerings through them? Let me tell you the truth. Although you will be able to find a job (if you're bi-lingual), it will only pay you 400usd a month. The prices of everything in Panama is slowly on the rise. People cannot keep up with these price hikes. My aunt only makes 60usd a week, that is quite sad. Panama is a wonderful place to visit,but unless you are independently wealthy, I suggest you do not go down there to work.

Looking for a NONINVASIVE CARDIOLOGIST. Can you help us.? We are desperately looking for a non-invasive, non-interventional cardiologist. We need a doctor that prescribes non-invasive treatment, instead of surgery or interventional procedures.\n\nThank you for your help. Might I suggest you search for a Cardiac Nutritionist? 5 years ago I was put on a '6 month death list' by 'normal' cardiologists since I refused X-plant. They gave up on me and as a 'last resort' sent me to the 'nutcase lady', so called because she feels diet and antibiotics are better treatments than what the "mechanics" do<g>. Needless to say I'm still here and doing *much* better than if I'd had the surgery<rofl>!
Why do we want what we cant have? im in this situation...my boyfriend and i have been dating for about 8 months now. i really love him and i want to have the best relationship possible, but i keep hearing all of these rumors. like he's always flirting with all of these other girls. when i ask him about things that really bother me he jumps off and it always seems to come back as me believing everything i hear. he wants me to express my self and be real with him but when i do it just doesnt come out right. i want him to be faithful, but i just dont know if i can trust him. i know that he really cares about me,,, but i also think that there are some sideline females that im not 2 sure about. i really need to know the truth, but i dont want to lose him...what should i do? i think the best way is honestly asking him and speaking up about how you feel.....theres really no easy way to do this and its hard to not feel jealous. i hated showing signs of jealousy towards my boyfriend but sometimes you have to.\ni know that in my last relationship i didn't speak up and ask him about other girls and he ended up breaking up with me for this other girl that was always sticking around.\ni was so upset about it, and knew he always had a thing for her too. well the good news was they went out for 2 months and realized she wasn't the same way i was. broke up with her and now is coming back to me. weird isn't it?

Different types of photosynthesis? What are different types of photosynthesis and what is the main differences in them, why cant all plants use the same one?? There are two main kinds of photosynthesis.  One kind is C3 photosynthesis and the other kind is C4 photosynthesis.  The main difference between them is that more water is conserved in C4 photosynthesis than in C3 photosynthesis.  C4 photosynthesis uses a different pathway to get CO2 into its photosynthetic cells. In order to perform this different CO2 transport mechanism C4 photosynthesis requires more energy from the absorption of light in the P700 independant photosystems, which just create energy.  So C4 plants conserve more water, but require more energy to perform their photosynthesis.  \nThe reason why all plants don't use the same kind of photosynthesis is because plants in some tropical areas grow where water is sparse so they must conserve water, and since they are in a sun rich area they are able to absorb more light to create energy.   The C3 plants live in cooler regions that tend to have more abundant water sources.  So C3 plants do not have to conserve water and grow where light is not as plentiful so they are not able to create extra energy from the absorption of extra light.  Therefore plants growing in temperate regions use C3 photosynthesis.\n\n\nNote: Plants do not choose what type of photosynthesis they use.  Plants will either only perform C3 photosynthesis or they will only perform C4 photosynthesis.

I have a Compaq Deskpro a Pentium II, 9.30GBh.dr.,7.23GBFree.I went from 64mg to 256mg RAM,now it locks up.Why I increased my ram from 64mg to 256mg.,by useing 2-128mg sticks of memory.The pc starts up alright and I am able to use the net,but every once in a while it locks up suddenly for no apperant reason.Then I hit the on/off button to reboot.Can anyone tell me why this is happening and how to correct it? You don't give enough info for me to check to see if your computer can handle that much memory; check at www.crucial.com to see if it can.  There's a chance that one of the sticks is malfunctioning; either that it is just has bad memory, or you could have damaged one with static electricity while installing them.  First, check your specific model with crucial to see if your system can handle two 128 mb modules.  If they say you can, then test each module.  You can do this with your original module.  Put the 64 mb module in the first slot (if you can't find the marking, it is generally the slot closest to your motherboard).  Then put one of the 128 mb modules behind it.  Run your computer for a while and see if you have any problems.  If not, then try with the other 128 mb module, and run for a while to see if you have any problems with that one.  This will show you which one is causing the problem.

wieght loss? well in the past 6 months or so ive gained 80 pounds and have been trying to loose it.  ive tried crash dieting a few times but have never had the will power to go threw with it. what i need is how to get the will power Crash dieting will make you fatter in the long run. This is because your body goes into starvation mode. The human body is designed to hang onto fat in case of famine. This is something that we have carried with us since before we were living in caves and evolved because food sources were less certain at that time. We live in a modern world now where there is plenty of food. But our evolution is still in the caves and our bodies do not recognise this (unfortunately). Hence the minute we cut calories drastically to try to lose weight quickly, our bodies behave as though each meal will be our last. The end result is our metabolisms slow right down. That is why we often end up fatter after a period of crash dieting. \n\nWhat you need to do is try to shift your mindset and make a lifestyle change that you will stick to. This calls for a new way of looking at food and eating for the rest of your life. The problem with diets is most people see them as short term fixes. Once they have achieved what they want to achieve (i.e. weight loss), lots of people just go back to their former eating habits - then they are surprised that the weight comes back again - in spades!\n\nNutritionists everywhere agree that a healthy, balanced diet is the key to good health. Focus your diet on variety - primarily brightly coloured vegetables and fruit (no more than 2 pieces of fruit a day - 3 in a pinch) with more focus on vegetables. Give up mayo and fatty dressings. Cut fat off meat - visible fat - and remove the skin from chicken. Cook with any method that does not involve adding fat. Do not eat anything in breadcrumbs or pastry. Reduce bread but if you can't, eat wholegrain bread. Reduce fats generally. Minimise fast food. Drink water instead of fruit juices and diet soda (I posted something here about diet soda earlier - it is not our friend!). Cut out ALL processed foods - white anything, sugar, candy and cakes. Instead, snack on nuts (or raw vegetables not dried fruit). \n\nMost of all, accept that you did not get fat overnight and you will not get slim overnight either. Tell yourself that this is a long term solution and you are willing to do the whole haul for the sake of your health.\n\nIf you decide not to follow these principles and instead try to crash diet again, chances are in 6 months - a year's time, you will be looking back still fat (if not fatter) and asking the same question about weight loss.
effects of inflation on a country's political and economic system? inflation effects interest rates, exchange rates, the cost of living and general confidence in a country's political and economic system Well, your additional comments kind answer your question. The thing with inflation is the next. Prices start going up, mainly caused by excess in demand, lets try to see it with a simple example. If prices of raw material go up, final distributors have to rise prices to obtain the same level of profit. Everyone can raise prices if they want, but what happens with the consumers. They can´t ask for a rise, they have annual contracts. So prices go up, income stays the same. Businesses have to close or turn down production. With less production, less people are employed. Less people employed, less income to spend and the thing becomes very critical. So economical system enters a recession or, if not treated correctly, a depression. Depression with inflation means high prices and little income to buy them... if you still got your job. Politically, central banks have 1 prioritary goal, which is to mantain the purchasing power of their currency. So when inflation is hiking up, central banks try to do anything to stop it. How? Raising intrest rates to stop investment and consumption, which will lower demand for goodsA more extreme measure, but rarely followed because of the political cost, would be a tighter fiscal policy,which in short states to rise taxation. The Us is right now trying to avoid, or cool down inflation, by hiking up intrest rates. So, for some 2 years, the political agenda has been a rise in intrest rates, when 10 years ago it was the other way around!\n\nHope that helps. Good luck!
Can one really buy a home with NO MONEY DOWN and poor credit?   YES! I personally have purchased 2 houses and a 3 unit apartment house this way. I put a grand total of 12 dollars down payment ( in MI, a real estate contract isn't valid unless some money changes hands) I flipped 2 of them and kept the 3 unit for a couple of years, then sold it too. My credit score is around 525 but I never went through any credit checks with the owners. It does take a LOT of persistence and determination though.

Why is the Media trying to take the very little bad things that happened w/o the immigrants and...? turn it into a big problem. I was watching my local news yesterday and the spent 10 min out of 30min trying to highlight the negative. In the whole state (Indiana) one restruant closed (what do you wanna bet that is was a Mexican restruant), one landscaping company said 90% of its worker didn't show up (THEY ONLY HIRE MEXICANS!), and a meat packing plant shut down (who cares?). They also said how all the business on West Washington closed (they failed to say that basically all mexicans live there). The media are a bunch of liberal trolls who want to manipulate the ordinary people of this country, who want to ROUND THEM UP AND SEND THEM HOME!!!!!!!!!!
Does she like me? Or are we friends? I just graduated college, and today I got this message on Facebook from a girl that I was friends with. She said she wishes me the best for the future and misses me. While we were in college we had to work alone on a project several times. During this time, we came to be fairly good friends. I would often walk her back to where we parted toward our own apartments. A lot of flirtation went on between us, but she and I never admitted probably because our social group does not date much. We see each other as brother and sister, and so she calls me her brother. But why the heck does she miss me? Nobody else has written me anything. Are we good friends, or are we more than friends? If you need more info, let me know. Thanks! First off, do you know if she's single or seeing someone right now? She could just miss you as a good friend, what I think you should do is ask her yourself. Either get her number or meet with her if you're in the same area. Do it casually, don't make it seem like a big deal. Just reminisce about old times and casually bring up your relationship back then. Ask her if she ever thought of you as maybe more than a friend or if there was ever a possibility of there being more between you two. The worst that she could say is you're just a friend, and you'll never be satisfied until you find out for sure. Trust me, I'm learning the hard way. Hope this helps a little.

Should I feel upset that my husband gets his hair cut by his X wife? Im not a jealous person by nature, so when Im taken by the green eyed moster...its really ugly. I think what Im feeling is jealousy or SOMETHING... Im VERY upset that he is letting her cut his hair tho. We bought a hair cut kit for at home so I could cut his hair (did this 2 years ago) and I've cut it every time since then. Well, he wants to get his hair cut before thanksgiving and I wont be home. I could do it tomorrow NIGHT, but not till then. But when his X started cosmetology school 5 months ago, I told him then that it would bother me if she cut his hair, so If I ever couldnt cut his hair, to go somewhere else (NOT HER). So then... he schedules an apt to go there AT HER SALON...and get his hair cut. AND THEN proceeds to tell his X that I dont want her cutting his hair! THAT JUST MAKES ME SO MUCH MORE MAD! Im so MAD I COULD SCREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Am I wrong..??? No, you're not wrong. Unless hers is THE ONLY salon in the radius of 100 miles, he should respect your wishes, and go elsewhere. There's no hard feelings between myself and my ex, but I would never ask him to do a house remodel for my husband and I (he works in construction). This would be in bad taste; there are plenty of other contractors out there.

how trojan horse work ? Explain in detail. if possible then must be with diagram or step ..?   Hi!\n\nA trojan horse is a program (application) that has vile code contained in it.\nOnce it gets in your computer (and there are many ways) it runs (it can be set to run).\nIt configures your system to load and run it every time your computer starts.\nIt waits, patiently, for a client application (known as trojan client) to connect (most of the time by username and pass), then takes control of the system.\nOnce the client is connected the user of the trojan has much control of the system, to most files and folders, application...\nThe confidential data on it becomes quite public, that's why, a trojan (horse) is the no 1 security threat.\nLiterally, the trojan makes the system... insecure, and so, one can get all your passwords, accounts, personal data, leading, in many cases, to identity theft.\nNasty!\n\nGood luck!

If there are 3.0 mol of an ideal gas in the cylinder at 400 K, determine the height, h, at which the piston will be in equilibrium under its own weight. \n\nHere is a link to the figure:\n\nhttp://i136.photobucket.com/albums/q200/physics2006/physics.gif here, as the gas is in equilibrium,the pressure exerted by the piston should equal the pressure exerted by the gas..                    Ppiston=mass/area =5g/0.047pa. Use the ideal gas law now..  V=nRT/P and so,area*ht(=V)=nRT/P this implies ht.H=nRT/aP and use your units carefully..i think the answer will be around 203.67502 km
hi all i have a project to do? It is about organizational improvement,do u nkow any website that does a project for money.I really want to get A+,for example the project is about i have a healthcare company i should improve the technology in it and the staff memebers.There is some table of content to follow I'm not sure I understand what you're looking for here.  A website that does projects for money?  That's a bit broad - can you be more specific?
I'm probably going to get blasted for asking this...? ...but is there anybody else who feels that there is too much advertisement and slander when it comes to politics? It's on television, newspaper, telephone poles and homemade signs on people's front yards, in the mail, and even on the phone! I understand that people have a right to stand up for what they believe in, and I respect that, but the advertisements...do you think it's gone too far? I have always felt that the slander and smear tactics that politicians use steer away from the actual question of "What can THEY do to help the country?" You, as a politician, telling me what this other candidate did or didn't do has nothing to do with what you're going to do. If anyone follows politics, they would already know what that person has done or not done politically. Just once, I would like to see a candidate not talk about his opponent in a demeaning way and talk about what they plan to do to help this country. Don't insult our intelligence by trying to distract us like little children. When you finish bashing your opponent, I still want to know what YOU'RE going to do.
I want a tattoo? What do you think? I am going to turn 18 and someone told me to do something that i will remember my eighteenth birthday so should i get a tattoo? do they hurt? what should i get? any ideas in mind? I need someone;s idea or if a tattoo isnt it then what should i do ? tattoos only hurt depending on where you get them, my recommendation to you is to get a small tattoo that can be easily consealed by clothing or is concealed by clothing if you are wearing a shirt and shorts. the reason being is that if at some point down the road you absolutely hate your tattoo then you can at least keep it covered, it wont affect your ablity to get a job (because it is covered) and if you dont use colors other than black and blue it can be removed easier. and as far as what to get, get something that says something about you, not something you might change your mind on later in life. for example my gf got a tattoo of autumn leaves on her ankle because her middle name is autumn, which isnt likely to change. so dont be getting tattoos of what is cool now, get something that is relatively timeless

Are Republicans really the racist party? I had a client last week to whom I was telling that I had a guy doing my house top to bottom.  She expressed some interest in maybe having him do some work for her.  Mind you, she is a gay woman who is extremely liberal.  The first question she asked me was:  "What is his ethnicity?"  When I told her, she lost interest.  Who is the racist here? Interesting question. Republicans, in principle cherish small government and the freedom to expand economic activity.They will respect the citizen who is contributing to the economy, no matter what race he or she belongs to.\nDemocrats cherish big government and the idea of creating and maintaing a population dependent on the government.\nIn different ways, both Republicans and Democrats can be seen as racists.\nThere is another group much more dangerous than racists; the liberals. They discriminate against their own country

Is the AP European History test as easy as the AP World History test?   AP Euro is usually considered harder (at least at my school) since it is so specific. AP world is more broad with less minor details that you need to know. At my school, you take world in freshman year and euro during sophomore year, so euro should be harder since we took it at a later time.\n\nHope this helped :)

Atlanta fans....Trade Vick? Atlanta fans are you ready to give up on Vick?  This guy has really not done anything but win one play off game in Lambeau field.  Every third week he has a good game and twice a year he will pass the ball well.  But last week did it for me, you don't diss your own fans, the people who have your back after each of your bad games. This guy is a mess, just like his brother.  Vick is never going to be a great QB, he might get you into the play offs, but he does not have what it takes to win a Super Bowl....are you ready to trade him? Pass his problems onto some other team, I think Schaub is a better fit for the team anyways.  AND if management did not agree with me, why haven't they traded away Schaub in the last two offseasons when his stock was high? You make a solid case for trading michael Vick.  I often wonder if the receivers feel the same way.  They have a solid receiving corps and an excellent tight end.  Vick was an excellent college quarterback, and he still is.  If they could run the option and mix in the pass sporadically he would be the perfect fit.  But in the NFL the option is just not an option. (funny?....nah)  You are correct about Schaub.  He seems to be a nice QB with an accurate arm and good decision making skills.  I think Vick is too concerned with proving to everyone that he can pass when most would be satisfied if he can prove that he can win.  I think he has the skills to be a good QB but he must work on his accuracy and decisions.  I think Atlanta is not the right place for him.  They want to run the west coast offense for which Schaub would be an excellent fit.  I say trade him.  You won't get the full value.  Maybe take a second round pick.

Question regarding leases? Gf and I and a friend moved into a apartment and signed a lease. Besides the fact her and I didn't work out, how do I go about getting dropped from the lease. And will I have to pay any penalties? They are going to continue living there, i am just going to move out because we broke up. Anyone with some knowledge  enlighten me? You are most likely gonna get stuck paying til the lease is over even if you move. Unless they are civil and both decide to pay half and let you leave. As far as the landlord, probably won't care as long as their still getting paid. I would get all agreements in writing and have all parties sign. Just so no problems occur down the line. You don't want to be livin' it up with a new girl and have the ex decide she's bitter.

My daughter needs 6 more points on her ACT test, which is the best ACT prep to raise your score?   6 points is a DRASTIC increase, and most research shows that retesters often score lower.\n\nWhy does she need to score so much higher? If it is for a school, I'd suggest looking into a school that more appropriately suits her talents and abilities.\n\nHowever, if you and her are intent on increasing it, I'd suggest a program through Kaplan. It is expensive though. If she'll self study, the ACT prep book published by the College Board themselves was very helpful to me.\n\nIf she is not a Junior currently, know that her score will increase. We took an old version of the ACT in my Sophomore year. I got a 28 then. When I took it my Junior year, I got a 34. Obviously, that is a drastic increase. If she is younger, get her studying now. Have her take AP classes to boost her knowledge. Have her take practice tests. Make sure on the real test day, she has gotten adequate  sleep and eats a healthy breakfast. Help her feel confident going into the test, and she'll likely do better!\n\nIf she is a Junior currently, she may not be able to boost her score that much, but it will still help to try some study books or programs. Also, most if not all schools will accept the ACT and SAT interchangeably. I personally did worse on the SAT than on the ACT, but I know many people who did better on the SAT. Maybe she could sign up to try to take that.\n\nI hope she gets the results she hopes for, but don't let her beat herself up about it! Whatever your score-14, or 34, she'll end up somewhere good for HER. If her score doesn't accurately reflect her abilities and talents, there are other places on an application to make those clear. Work on helping her write a strong personal statement for instance.\n\nGood luck to both of you!\n-Nicole

what kind of soil is best for planting beans? is it plain dirt , potting soil with plant food , or potting soi   You'd do better to plant beans in the ground.  They're usually big, vigorous climbers and need some room and stakes or strings or cages or something like that to support their twining growth.  Plus, they need some sun, so make sure you have the right growing conditions for them.\n\nAs far as dirt, long-release plant food like in potting mix tends to support flower growth, which is not exactly what you want.  You want some leaves, some roots, some flowers (gotta have flowers to get beans)...potting soil is too specific.  I'd get some topsoil in a bag and mix in some rotten manure (if you don't have a manure pile around, beg some from somebody with farm animals or buy a bag pre-rotted.)  It *has* to be rotten--raw manure uses up nitrogen in order to rot, and beans need their nitrogen.\n\nMix the two until the result is black and crumbly.  Or, mix the rotted manure in with your soil in the ground.  Good rotten manure doesn't stink--it just smells like earth.  Plant, mind the pests, and water as needed.  Good compost is a pretty good bet, too.  Use like rotten manure.

Divorce....................? A married couple is driving down the interstate doing 55 mph. The husband is behind the wheel. His wife looks over at him and says, "Honey, I know we've been married for 15 years, but, I want a divorce."\n\nThe husband says nothing but slowly increases speed to 60 mph.\n\nShe then says, "I don't want you to try to talk me out of it, because I've been having an affair with your best friend, and he's a much better lover than you."\n\nAgain the husband stays quiet and just speeds up as his anger increases.\n\nShe says, "I want the house." Again the husband speeds up, and now is doing 70 mph.\n\nShe says, "I want the kids, too."\n\nThe husband just keeps driving faster, and faster, now he's up to 80 mph.\n\nShe says, "I want the car, the checking account, and all the credit cards, too."\n\nThe husband slowly starts to veer toward a bridge overpass piling, as she says, "Is there anything you want?"\n\nThe husband says, "No, I've got everything I need."\n\nShe asks, "What's that?"\n\nThe husband replies just before they hit the wall at 90 mph, "I've got\nthe airbag!" Hilarious!!!!\ngot divorced about a year ago.
Pelosi as President.  Far fetched?? The type of woman she is DOES MATTER.? Nancy Pelosi may not be running for any office today but today is definitely a referendum on Nancy Pelosi. \n\nIf the Democrats win the majority of the House from the Republicans today she will be the Speaker of the House and third in line to be President if something should happen to Bush and Cheney. \n\nEntitlements for the poor paid by high taxes. She plans on raising taxes, all taxes not simply overturning the Bush tax cuts. Which, by the way, included tax cuts that saved MiddleClass American families $2,000 a year. Gone. She wants them repealed immediately. \n\nNancy Pelosi has a strong anti-military attitude. She has voted against every piece of legislation brought before the House to better equipt our men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIf you want a person like Pelosi to be Commander and Chief of our military then by all means ignore how she would rape the military budget.\n\nLegalized drugs\n\nUnfettered abortion rights (She supports partial birth abortions) how true!! let's not leave out the fact that she also wants to ban ALL private ownership of firearms of ANY type.

Why did The Marines forsake Jesus? Toys for Tots rejects Jesus doll\n\nLOS ANGELES - A talking Jesus doll has been turned down by the Marine Reserves' Toys for Tots program.\n\n A suburban Los Angeles company offered to donate 4,000 of the foot-tall dolls, which quote Bible verses, for distribution to needy children this holiday season. The battery-powered Jesus is one of several dolls manufactured by one2believe, a division of the Valencia-based Beverly Hills Teddy Bear Co., based on Biblical figures.\n\nBut the charity balked because of the dolls' religious nature.\nToys are donated to kids based on financial need and "we don't know anything about their background, their religious affiliations," said Bill Grein, vice president of Marine Toys for Tots Foundation, in Quantico, Va.\n\nAs a government entity, Marines "don't profess one religion over another," Grein said Tuesday. "We can't take a chance on sending a talking Jesus doll to a Jewish family or a Muslim family."\n\nhttp://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061114/ap_on_re_us/jesus_dol They did FINALLY take them. I think someone pointed out that Musilms and Jews don't celebrate Christmas, and I think the toys are designed to be CHRISTMAS presents. I didn't know toys for tots handled Haunkah and Muslim kids too! Wow! (Sarcasam here). Seriously though, 4,000 toys?! To turn that down is crazy! I don't care who gets them, the kids will be happy to have a Christmas. Who would turn away 4,000 toys?!

Is IQ really that important? I mean I just had an online free IQ test on the site www.QueenDom.com, and I got a fucking 116 score, the explanation says that my performance on the test was well above the population average, however to me it seems to be really low. But I've always have almost straight As at school, top of most of my classes, etcetera. \nSo does IQ really defines something? If it does tell me what could I do for increasing my logical thinking, my intelligence or something.\nThanksss Stop and think about what IQ means literally. It's got next to nothing to do with what you know, but rather, your ability to learn. Someone with a less than 100 (average) IQ can still learn as much as someone with a higher IQ, they will just struggle more doing so. 116 is nothing to be ashamed of.

Do you keep your food separated on your plate? I know this is stupid, but I had an argument with somebody at Thanksgiving. They complained because I let my food get mixed together. Upon asking other people, a lot of people try to keep the food items separated on their plate. I found this absurd. What is so bad about mixing turkey with stuffing, or potatoes with squash? Some foods are meant to be mixed together. I happen to love a sandwich made of turkey, dressing, cranberries, and cole slaw. I have had the same dumb arguement, LOL, and I always say that the food all ends up mixed together so what is the harm in letting it mix together on the plate?  People need to chill.  I am right there with you, I love turkey and cranberry sandwiches with alittle dressing.

Can your share your HK USP experiences? I started liking this pistol. But I only own the airsoft replica.\n\nSomeday, I will save enough money to buy a real one ( I will go for the .40 s&w USP).\n\nCan you share your real-life shooting experiences with the USP?\n\nIs the gun accurate enough? Reliable? \n\nWhat are the likes and the dislikes you experienced? And most importantly, what caliber is yours? I carried the USP .40cal for about 2 years as a police officer.  My department has now switched to the Beretta 92g 9mm.  I liked the USP much more.  It would fire when dirty, it was easy to clear malfunctions, the grip is solid and rigid, the sights are reliable, and it never misfired unless the ammo was faulty.  Great gun.  The only thing i did not like about the issued USP was the 12lbs trigger pull.  A privately bought gun will not have such a stiff pull.  It is a great gun,  Really, anything made by HK is great.
how come every time you here of some-think about "god".. people always go to that book called the holy bible i herd that the pope got upset that the da vin ci code sold more book then the holy bible.. and that the da vin ci code was made by a man in france... and some other guy saying there is a blood line... also the same as the holy bible... it started in Rome by some guy wanting to control where he was liveing and was bulling people into giveing them money to keep his Faith and greed going through human history.. just like where it is today.. with the pope we have in Rome or where ever the hell he lives There has never been a book that has out sold the Bible, so wherever you heard that, it is incorrect. As Christians, we use the Bible for many different things, including instructions on living good lives. Good Luck!!!!

What unit is used to measure motion?   Motion itself is measured by velocity, which is defined as the change in distance over some unit of time.  In physics, the standard expression of velocity is in meters per second, or m/s.  Velocity is a vector quantity, which means that it has both a magnitude (a number) and a direction (plus/minus, or compass heading, or whatever works in the context).\n\nForce, even net force, cannot be a measure of motion, because force by itself says nothing about its impact on the object -- we must also know the mass of the object to derive motion from force (Force = mass*acceleration).  Even then, we cannot directly compute velocity; instead, we get the acceleration of the object, which measures the change in velocity that the force brings to the object (in other words, acceleration is the change in 'meters per second,' per second, and is thus written as m/s^2).

home work for my child "if there were no star what will happen to sky?"?   First, if that is an exact quote from the teacher, that teacher needs to proof read their work.\n\nThe only star that has a significant influence on our plane, and therefor our sky is the sun.  The sky generally refers to the atmosphere, which consists of different types of gasses: nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor and many others.  If the sun were to suddenly disappear it would get very cold very quick.  The temperature on the surface of the Earth would fall to below -200 degrees Celsius.  The gases in the atmosphere would all liquefy at this temperature, therefor what we refer to as the sky would exist no more.  We would be similar to the pseudo planet Pluto.  One difference is that our planet does have a molten core that would add warmth to a degree that I can not guess.\n\nTo sum up:  without the sun, we would have a cold, dark planet with no atmosphere to speak of, therefor no sky.

And keep in your head.\n!. Christ died for the person, not you.\n2. God is Love, he is not working in the spirit of Fear, but peace and sound mind. (So no hell stuff)\n3. Your the walking testimony, how you talk, act, and re act, will be your light.\n4. Its, CHRIST IN YOU.  So keep your thoughts out of it.\nUse the Bible verses. John 3:16...\nLet the bible be your voice. It has more power then your own. \n5. Pray, and be in prayer, listen, for Gods voice in you telling you what to say, when the time is right.\n6. God did not jump down your heart, you put him there in your time.  Everyone has a time, not our time.\n7. Judgment belongs to God. And him alone. \n8.

Please rate my poem!!? It was my fault\n\nThere once was a guy i used to sit next to in class. He would slit his wrists to make time pass. No one ever seemd to notice but me. i just sat there quietly. You could tell how he felt if you just glanced at his eyes. Maybe thats why his death wasnt such a suprise. His eyes were dark and hopless inside. His wrists looked sore streaked with red lines. Maybe if i spoke up this would all be a lie. But sadly its the truth. i just wanted to cry. Was his death my fault? How can this be? It seems so unreal, im still in disbelief . Eventually some day, i will get over it. Maybe later on i wont feel so much regret. I wish i got to know him more, maybe we could have been friends... but theres no scence in wishing now, his life has all ready had its end.\n\nR.I.P You assume responsibility for the sin of someone else.  You, a sinner, insist upon paying the price for another person's sin, which is not Christ like.  A sinner cannot save another sinner.  There is no salvation in this poem for you or the suicide victim.  Structurally it is good, though.  It does express an idea that most people are oppressed by, that the failures of others are somehow their fault.

If you could only listen to one song the rest of your life, what would it be and why ?

If the Black Stone of the Ka’aba fell at the feet of Adam, what happened to it in the worldwide flood? It is claimed by Muslims that the (originally pagan) Black Stone of the Ka’aba, in Mecca, fell from the moon and landed at the feet of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden. There is no historical or Biblical evidence for this belief.  Obviously, unless it was taken aboard the Ark by Noah it would have been lost during the worldwide flood and so after the flood it could not have been identified from any other, ordinary piece of  black rock. As there is no evidence for a black stone being taken on board the Ark, perhaps someone can explain,- - - \n1. How anyone could possibly know that it fell at the feet of Adam and Eve? \n2. What happened to it during the flood? \nPlease give evidence. The Black Rock was examined during the early part of this century, it is an unusually large piece of meteoritic material.  All other stories are superstitious nonsense.

If fat boy Michael Moore stepped on a land mine and blew up...? Would it rain fat for a week?\n\nYour thoughts. No that's physically impossible. In much the same way one could pose the question if we dropped you head first onto a land mine, how far would the sawdust fly? There's no sawdust in yer head, you just don't know anything at all about politics so you resort to personal insults and juvenile humor as a means of advocating your stance on politics, 'cuz ya just don't know any better. That isn't to say you're an idiot, b/c really there isn't enough proof to substantiate that based solely on your lack of education in politics. If one were to check out your Q&A profile they would see that you have a sense of humor, and the capacity to respond intelligently. One could infer that you are stubborn and maybe a little headstrong in your ways, but that doesn't give an accurate or even a complete picture of your personality, or even your intellect, so again we are at a stand-still.

Investment property? Looking for advice from fellow Australians.? Do you think it's better to buy units or houses? Units seem to be more appealing because the gap between rental income and the mortgage is smaller, but the appreciation would be less? Am interested in hearing your opinions as we've saving a decent deposit and are wondering where to go from here. We currently live overseas so can't buy something to live in at this stage. My personal preference is houses rather than units, because:\n- land appreciates, which you get with houses, not units\n- you have more financial control with a house, as strata fees can be imposed on you when you have a unit\n- you have more development/improvement opportunities for a house than a unit.

Will Tom Brady ever win a regular season MVP? Does he have to go over 4000 yards again to be awarded it? I think Brady is very good, and even though he has not the most prolific numbers, he has been over 3600 yards passing 4 years in a row, and is on his way to his 5th. He has posted the 7th highest career passer rating in history so far, and it will probably get higher. as long as peyton manning is playing, tom brady will never outplay him and win a regular season mvp.

Do white people hate being called "Cracker" and why?   I hate the term cracker.  It makes no sense whatsoever and really displays the stupidity of the person using it.  This and the even worse term, "honky" are specific slurs that were, at one time, used against immigrants from certain countries but they were never in widespread use.\n\nFurther, there are no negative stereotypes to associate with the words, making them ridiculous.  The N word has a great many negative things associated with it.  It is an unfortunate fact that many of those stereotypes are embraced by many black people.  That's what gives the word its potency.  If someone calls you that and you know that many other black people have the qualities the word implies, the word has potency as an insult.\n\nBut for cracker and related terms, there are no negative associations.  The average white person is like, I'm not even sure what that means.  You might as well make up a word for all the meaning it has.  At least when the nation calls us white devils, we know what the hell they mean by that, even if it is ridiculous by nature of being obviously untrue.
Partial Pressure and mass? In a mixture of   Ne   and   H2   gases, the partial pressure of   Ne   is   0.180 atm.   The total pressure is   0.410 atm.   The temperature is   28.0oC.   If the total volume of the gas mixture is   421 mL,   what is the mass of   H2   in grams? The partial pressure of H2 is just the total pressure minus the partial pressure of Ne.  The ratio of the H2 part press and total press gives the mole fraction of H2.  \n\nNow just calculate the number of moles in your 421 mL using the ideal gas equation  PV = nRT.  Solve for n, multiply this by the mole fraction of H2 to get the moles of H2, then multiply this by the mole weight of H2.\n\nI'll let you do the math.

Has anyone  experienced or know about salivary gland tumors?   Salivary gland tumors comprise less than 3% of head & neck tumors.  Between 75% and 85% are in the parotid gland and approximately 70% of those are benign mixed tumors (pleomorphic adenomas).  Tumors may be benign or malignant and occur in the parotid, the submandibular salivary gland, or in the minor salivary glands found in the lining of the oral cavity.
What are the most common Polish wedding traditions?   White dress, and a really, really BIG party with a lot of vodka!!:) The party is for some people more important than saying "yes" in a church.. (not only there, but usually...) Bride's family organizes the party, etc, and groom's buy alcohol. That is the tradition, but actually most of the couples just earn money by themeselves to afford they own wedding.. Ok, so - the party, alcohol, dancing, and strange patterns during the party;) Is is goos to get married in a month having the letter "r" in a name:)\nWhat we don't have or is not common:\n-getting married somewhere outside, in a place chosen by you.\n-couple arrives to the church together, \n-the father doesn't lead his doughter through the church\n-no superstitions concerning seeing the bride before the wedding; \n-no blue, borrowed, old, new things\n-bride doesn';t throw the flowers; \nBut generally we start to incorporate western habits.. So - lists of presents become popular:)
what are Semester Hours? and Full-Time students?   Semester hours are the number of hours you are taking.  Each class is worth so many hours.  Usually 1-4 but some might be higher.  It usually equals the number of hours you are in class per week.  \n\nFull Time students are classified differently at different places.  usually 12 hours or about 4 classes is considered full-time.  However, for most programs if you want to graduate on time you have to take more like 16-19 hours.
Does anyone else think America is headed towards a police state? The Internet's dictionary.com website defines "police state" as: "A state in which the government exercises rigid and repressive controls over the social, economic and political life of the people, especially by means of a secret police force." \n\nas General Tommy Franks recently suggested, that moment will come when yet another serious terrorist attack, provoked and instigated by our own meddling, interventionist, imperialistic government, occurs on our soil. All the necessary “laws” are now in place! Never mind that they are all completely unconstitutional! And never mind as well that the finishing touches of our unconstitutional “laws” have been finalized and put in place by a “limited government” Republican administration! America is now “legally” a police state!\n\nPersonaly, I think America is being destroyed by design.\nIt doesnt matter who gets elected as President, they are just a puppet, taking orders from somewhere else. To a certain degree you have fulfilled the qualifications of a Police State.  Habeus corpus waves bye bye.

Why do people salivate while sleeping? Is there any remedy to stop it? I know people aged 35 doing it !? I know it about guys but not sure about gals that if they salivate during sleep or not. There are many theories that it may be caused due to improper sleeping or some disorder. But I haven't found one single medication, therapy, or assistance in getting rid of the habit ! I am a grown man drolling like a baby !! It is normal for someone who sleeps with their mouth open to drool.  We all do it.  You should try sleeping in a different position.  It doesn't hurt anything and does not indicate some sort of sleep disorder.  It is not a habit that can be overcome, it is your body's natural function to keep the mouth moist.  If you can find a way to keep your mouth closed while sleepng, you won't drool.

Weight gain, mirena coil, prozac for anxiety disorder, ovarian cyst, impending 40th birthday.? I have all these things. Do you think any of them are related? The mirena coil and ovarian cyst could be related.  One of the side effects of the mirena coil is endometriosis.  Also, however, ovarian cysts can come and go, and possibly (even though 40 is a bit young) you could be in para-menopausal and sometimes ovarian cysts can develop yet dissolve on their own.  Also, at 40 your metabolism will begin to slow down, so it's best to watch your calorie intake and keep up daily exercise to avoid weight gain.  At 40 your body begins not to want to metabolize all the sweets and fats that it handled when you were younger.  As for the Prozac; how long have you been on it?  Even though Prozac, when you first start taking it, causes a decrease in appetite, after you have been on it for possibly a couple of years, a side effect can be just the opposite.  All in all, 40 is a great age.  Enjoy this next decade.  It could be the best time of your life.

How can you cure insomnia?   Get plenty of fresh air and exercise during the day, if you're not physically tired it's much harder to sleep.\nHave a routine, go to bed and get up at the same time each night and morning.\nCut out caffeinated drinks after 6 p.m. Save stimulating activities for earlier on in the day. To feel sleepy you need to wind down so as the evening draws on have a warm bath, afterwards change into night clothes and maybe have a small snack and drink if you need one.\nMake sure your bedroom is comfortably warm and dark. Don't watch T.V. in bed and make sure there is no clutter on the bed.\nReally important - don't drink (alcohol) or smoke in excess before you go to bed. If you do when it wears off you'll wake up and find it really hard to go back to sleep.\nDon't worry too much. If you're fretting about something that can be sorted get up and do it. If you can't, then forget about it til tomorrow.\nIf you use chamomile tea instead of tea/coffee you will feel the difference (more relaxed)
Nose problems...? Earlier this year in spring, I got a cold which developed into sinusitus - we think! Anyway, during the summer I got slight hayfever so in July, I got Flixonase and used that for a couple of months and it worked wonders! However, a month without using it, and it's come back. It's worse in the morning, I sneeze constantly and my nose is SO itchy and I just have to blow my nose all the time! Just like a constant cold, it comes and goes though, sometimes its bad, sometimes its not. Any ideas?!?!? The symptoms you are describing leads me to believe that you have allergies, not a lingering cold.  During the Fall and Spring, people with allergies are miserable, and have the same symptoms you have described.  I would contact my physician and get a new prescription for the spray since 'it worked wonders'.  Good luck.

I totally need answers now...this is needed for my major subject; ANATOMY..\n\nThanks so much..\n\n:) Cerebral edema may occur if a person has been hypoglycemic for a long time or other causes.

How can I inform the IRS of payment adjustments on Schedule B of 941 form? We have several corporations we run payroll for, and I accidentally paid a semimonthly tax deposit under the wrong federal id number and bank account.  The tax has been paid, but applied to the wrong entity.  I have made a new payment today for the correct corp and will apply future taxes towards the overpaid corp's liability.  I just wondered since I know of the problem now if I can alert the IRS before filing Schedule B, or do I have to wait until they receive the 4th quarter report and post it and then send me a letter saying the tax is paid late, yadda yadda yaddda.... before I can send the explanation. \n\nI couldn't find anything on IRS website that addressed this. The IRS does not have any way to correct a 941 that has not yet been filed. When you receive your notice that your payment was late, you can provide them with the explanation you have given above and ask them to waive the penalty for reasonable cause. (They have authority to waive penalties, but they cannot waive interest that is due, so you will have to pay interest if it is charged.) I would attach a statement to the 941 when you file it with the whole explanation. They will probable not read it or act on it at the time it is received, but it is something you can point out when you appeal the penalty later.\n\nRamsGod did not read your info completely. You stated that you have already made up the missed payment for the corporation and will use up the overpayment on the other company before quarter -end.\n\nAn alternative, if you really want it, is to get power-of-attorney forms (form 2848) signed by an authorized officer of each corporation and submitted to the IRS for these 2 companies for the 941 reports. Then you can call them and get the amount that was applied to the wrong company transferred to the correct company. It's more work, but this way neither company will show up as delinquent.

If ur school has a dance team and cheerleading squad...would u consider them equal? this is more like ur opinion but i really wanna know if i m the one thinking wrong or people have an invalid argument. I am a 9th grade girl in high school & today was our pep rally. I m with a dance team...we are a club not school sponsored but student run. we were to perform and we did. but this one boy ruined our entire performance by jumping into our squads in the middle of performance. he didn't interrupt the groups that went before us but us.....he did it last year as well.\n\ni wanna know just wats going through ur mind right not. should he be punished? did he insult us? are we not compatible to the cheerleaders? just because he's popular and an athlete we are also afraid he might not get punished severly enough.\n\nwho is wacked.....me or him? Certainly this young man should suffer consequences for interrupting your performance. Whether your performance is as a club or as an athletic team (as the cheer squad at your school), he has no right to disrupt the pep assembly in that manner. \n\nYes, it was an insult to your group. Yes, you are compatible/equal to the cheerleaders. Many schools' dance teams started out as yours is doing: as an informal/intra-mural "club"/after-school activity and grew into a teacher/school-sponsored activity that is "legitimate" and eventually competes against other schools in inter-scholastic competition. \n\nUnfortunately, the punishment that he receives is not up to you and your group members. My suggestion to you would be to have your parents contact the administration and have THEM explain your and their frustration and disapoointment that another student would disrupt a performance of fellow students. The parents of the dance group  should also say that they expect some form of punishment that is somewhat severe for this young fellow since this is the second year in a row he has interrupted a pep rally. They should also emphasize how demoralizing it is for their daughters to have to experience this type of humiliation in front of the whole student body, when their daughters are trying to expose their fellow students to dance and rhythm. \n\nYou are not whacked -- he is!\n\nGood luck...

Senators Hoekstra and Roberts, both Republicans, wanted this information released to the public for political reasons to try and help their case that there were WMD in Iraq.  According to David Kay, head weapons inspector, these were documents that were retrieved prior to 1991 and were already known about before W invaded Iraq.\n\nSecond year nuclear physics majors do not have all the information needed to build a nuclear bomb, let alone a regular physics major.  This information was not previously available on the internet, that is an urban myth.\n\nThere is no doubt that Saddam was a future threat, but there is still no evidence that he was an imminent threat.\n\nThese are the facts.
Can anyone tell me anything about Patrick Valenzuela?   He's got more pull with the horses than most jockeys do!  He is a gifted person & that makes him a target of the so-called "dark side" of the racing industry.  He only listens to what is real.  I've only met a few horses who didn't like him!  Humans are his biggest problem.  He can't be bought or bullied into submission & for that, he is held in high regard by the rest of the working class on the backlot of the track.  He has a big heart & those of us who have worked with him seem to be the only ones who notice it!  :o)

Help on C# pls? hi.\n\ni am designing an e-exam booking system\n\n1. can u give me any clue on how to pop up a calendar and highlight those days red to mean the day is already fully booked, or yellow that it is partially booked and perhaps an indication of no. available for the latter, in the calendar itself.\n\n2. and how to export the data as xml within the application?\n\ntks! Hi there\n\nTo work with xml it is probably a good idea to create xml files and store data there. Then you can read the xml document and process the data there. The following links show some examples of working with xml :\n\nhttp://devresource.hp.com/drc/technical_articles/xmlprocess/index.jsp\n\nhttp://www.csharphelp.com/archives/archive199.html\n\nTo highlight days on a calendar do this:\n\nSelectedDatesCollection theDates = Calendar1.SelectedDates;\ntheDates.Clear();\ntheDates.Add(new DateTime(2006,11,21));\ntheDates.Add(new DateTime(2006,11,20));\ntheDates.Add(new DateTime(2006,11,19));\n   \nCalendar1.SelectedDayStyle.BackColor=System.Drawing.Color.Red;\n\nSet what the selected date is on the calendar and then change its back color to what ever you want. More infor here:\n\nhttp://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e057ff0d.aspx\n\nTo do a popup window use javascript and call \n\nwindow.open() method.\n\nYou can open up a .aspx page and display your calendar there:\n\nMore about window.open here:\nhttp://www.devguru.com/Technologies/ecmaScript/quickref/win_open.html\n\nHope this helps

Who was greater- Newton- the theorist or Newton- the experimenter? Sir Isaac Newton. Beyond question, it was his work as a theorist.  The story about the falling apple is about as apocryphal as the one about George Washington and the cherry tree.\n\nTo appreciate what Newton did, we must realize that he came after Kepler and Galileo.  Kepler, using Tycho's observational data, formulated three laws of planetary motion -- ellipses, equal areas in equal times, and the cube of the orbital radius equals the square of the period.  He did <not> explain why these laws obtained.  That was left to Newton.\n\nGalileo was a great experimenter, observer, and theorist.  His work with the inclined plane and falling objects produced g, the acceleration due to gravity ... but Galileo did not have the calculus, which explains instantaneous motion.  That was left for Newton.\n\nBecause of Kepler and Galileo, Newton had all the data he needed.  His great work -- all theoretical -- was to explain the results obtained by Kepler and Galileo.  Newton's three laws of motion -- uniform linear motion, F = ma, and conservation of momentum -- are all theoretical constructs which, when coupled with the calculus (his invention) and applied to "action at a distance" -- universal gravitation -- Kepler's and Galileo's results were derivable.\n\nHis invention of the calculus, described opaquely in the Principia Mathematica, was for use as a tool to support his work on gravitation.\n\nNewton was no slouch as an experimentalist -- sometimes.  He performed top quality leading-edge experiments with optics, backing up his results with theoretical insights.  He also devoted considerable time and energy to the pseudoscience of alchemy -- turning base metals into gold -- with lesser success.\n\nBut it was his theoretical work that established his lasting reputation.
how to prepare for retirement? i am now 55yrs old Dear Sir, this is a very deep question! There are so many ways in which you can prepare yourself - \n\n1. Finances - Make sure your finances are strong so that even after retirement you are able to maintain the same standard of living. Make sure you will be economically stable and independent even after retirement. This means - invest wisely!\n\n2. Emotionally - Here you won't have to do much; the moment you retire, it is like the final homecoming for you. From then on, you will become an indispensible part of the house just like the doors, windows and your wife have been all these years. Yes, you have been in the same family all these years, but from now on, you'll be more into the family than into anything else.\n\n3. Socially - Start gathering contacts of all your friends since childhood. Once you retire you will have lot of time, when you can visit them all and refresh friendships which will make you feel socially secure.\n\n4. Something for your wife - I would suggest that you start learning household chores! :D I know most Indian men hate to work at home. But think - after all these years you are finally getting retired from work - FREEDOM! But for your wife? She will have no difference in her work. In fact, she'll have greater work to do just cos you are at home! So make yourself available for simple, small things at home. IT IS NOT FEMININE TO WORK AT HOME! Unfortunately many Indians consider household chores as work for the females. It is not so! Moreover, it is one way of avoiding boredom.\n\n5. Something for yourself - Start feeling happy! You are going to enter second childhood! A time when you can do anything with no one to question you! I assume most of your responsibilities of life would be over by now or will soon be over. So you'll be a free bird - free to do anything you want! So start getting involved in all your old forgotten hobbies - singing, stamp collecting, reading, writing, etc etc! You may also plan to start visiting places. Try to travel around - pilgrimages or simply fun trips! And if your financial position allows it, do go abroad somewhere (like singapore) with your wife.\n\nYou've worked hard the whole of your life for others; spend the last part for yourself. It's YOUR life! Live it to the fullest!
I'm shy and don't have too many friends and I am going into college next year, I need help making friends? I would like to have some guy friends, but I would also like to become friends with some of the girls at college. How should I go about doing this. Don't worry, it will come more naturally than you think.  Often times there is a freshman orientation specifically built for you to get to know other people, group activities etc.  Join a few clubs, and go to the group gathering and campus events, get to know your roomies and people on your floor (assuming you are in a dorm) and you will do just fine.  You could also consider joining a frat/sorority if that is your kind of thing... but then it's kind of like "paying for your friends" so that's up to you.
How is it the right pronunciation of the cheers  LE CHAIM when you drink?   my jewish friends always pronounced it "la-HIGHM," except the h is a more guttural sound, almost like you're hawking something up.  in other words, open your mouth, kind of close your throat, then blow out, for the guttural, throaty "h" sound.

is there any way of finding out my GED test scores on the internet before time?

What rights do I have? I work at McDonalds and employees are smoking while working.? Question Details: I have having problems with employees smoking at a non smoking mcdonalds resturant in Ohio. Its after the dine in side closes and we are a 24hr resturant. I have contacted the owner of the resturant and she wont do anything about it becuase shes a smoker herself. What can I do to protect my self from the harful effects of second hand smoke. Managers allow this smoking also. I'm not sure what state you live in but you might want to contact your labor board to find out what the employer laws are.  In California, these have to be posted in a general employee space where every employee is likely to see it to refer to if need be.  Ours is in our convenience center and actually becomes good reading material while copying.  \n\nYou might also contact McDonald's corporate office.  If this is an independent franchise, city/state laws may  be in effect.  If anything, the manager will be cited (and perhaps fired) for not conforming to legal employment practices.  The second link is where to contact McDonald's - you could send an anonymous e-mail to ask about their employment practices.  Trust me, someone from their corporate office will investigate this.  But also try your city/state employment office to see what the law states about smoking in a food service establishment.  There may be a law that there should be a designated area for employees and if these people are disobeying this regulation, they could be fined or dismissed, as well as the manager.\n\nYou deserve a right to breathe clean air!
Ativan in cancer patients? My Grandmother was diagnosed with pancratic cancer in Oct, she is not taking chemo or radiation, no life saving measures can be done only comfort measusrs for her.  Why would her doctor perscribe Ativan for her?  It makes her loopy.  Thanks for your help. Ativan is to help calm her down.  I'm sure she is anxious about everything and it will keep her calm.  I get panic attacks and when they get bad, i take xanax, which makes me loopy too - i think the more she takes it, the more she'll build up a resistance and it will be less likely to make her loopy.  I'm sorry to hear about her diagnosis and wish her a painfree passing and comfort to you and your family.

why do people celebrate christmas if they arent christian???   That's something I could never understand.  But I assume it has something to do with the fact that this world has made Christmas into a commercial holiday rather than a religious one.
holiday celebration? How do you and your family celebrate the pending holidays? Not just Thanksgiving and Christmas but all the pending winter holiday? I guess I am asking for not just Pagan holidays but all practicing holidays.

what is Gmail i heard of email obvisouly but what is Gmail?   The other answers were pretty good. Here are the things they left out:\nGet Gmail invites from this site http://www.bytetest.com/ ( it's completely automated; click and you're at the Gmail sign-up page )\n\nWhat's so good about Gmail:\n1. You've got a huge amount of storage for your email: almost 3 GB\n2. You can use Google Docs and Spreadseets (web based word editor and excel spreadsheets )\n3. You can create your own web site with localized downloads ( 100 MB ) and tons of features.\n4. You can use Google Reader (  web based rss, xml, atom.. reader ); it's better than most desktop applications ( keyboard shortcuts ... and lots of features )\n5. You can use their calendar.....\n6. A lot of other things (all free)\n7. You don't need to switch right away; create your account see how it works; and switch when you feel comfortable (like me)

What is the purpose of Religion? First and foremost, before you answer this question, know that i would like an intellectual answer. I'm really tired of this endless debate on how religion lead us to salvation and how jesus can lead me to heaven. I'm not an atheist but i fail to understand why you advocates of religion need to constantly convert others. Is this a reflection of insecurity or doubt? How blinded we are to think that all that exists in the cosmos can be explained in a couple of books. There are more things in heaven and earth than exists in your philosophy.\nDo you not agree that the time you spent 'saving' others may be better spent helping the poor or making an actual contribution? What is the purpose of religion? Is it a means for us to live more meanigful lives or is it just a way to 'classify' us and segregate us and to divert attention away from what untites us? Good question.\nReligions are only different ways to become closer to the creator. Some people need more commands and religious ceremonies to reach higher level of virtue and purification; others need only few commands to become purify and a good person.\nReligions should regarded as intermediary means , religions themselves are not the goal.\nreligions can educate people to live in  peace and harmony, to love people and control our "natural vicious behavior"  and being virtuous.\nAll these can be  achieved only if we don't judge other people and don't try to convert them to any religion. If each one does all his efforts to educate himself and try to become a better person, then we all Will become better people.
My boss ask me to do this..? I am a senior manager in this company. I am new, about 2 months in this company.\n\nI am going out to meet some clients this week and my superior, one of the directors, had asked me to get their name and company stamp on one of the forms as a proof that I have visited them.\n\nThis is a normal procedure for lower ranking sales in the industry but as a part of the senior management I feel that there should be more trust. It's not like I am going home to sleep during those hours..\n\nWhat should I do? HR Managers reading this, perhaps you guys can advise. What is really visible and clear now that all companies left the flag of NO TRUST,\nthis is what i can feel rightnow,\nThis happens all the time with all people, honest and nonhonest,\nbut there's a trend now in management that smart manager who can put his subordinates under full control, making them feel like they are all thievs all the time,\nso that, nobody even think of making something wrong,\n\nbut for you,\nget him what he wants to prove you went there,\nand then, tell him you're dealing with a senior manager, not a junior fresh graduate !!!!\nIt's not a normal procedure to act like this with me

what precautions required for family members of a T B patient?   Previously chemoprophylaxis with INH, isolation of patient were done. Nowdays we don't isolate the patient and it is not necessary to take chemoprophylaxis also if your one member has got TB.\n\nThe best way is to treat the patient with short term chemoprypholaxis. If we give even single dose of Rifampicin the communicability of TB will reduce drastically upto 60%. \n\nSo have a standard treatment is enough.\n\nAnother thing we can't avoid acquisition of TB, most of us are infectd with TB, and shows diseases in certain conditions like low  immunity, AIDS and other condition when body fight system is poor.\n\nKeep you member in your home, give him/her atandard antiTB drugs, say him to use towel during coughing or sneezing, proper disposal of sputum and give him fresh air, good nutrition.\n\nHowever if the member is your intimate like partner and you can't avoid and he/she is in active stage then only you can take INH chemoprophylaxis, however is is is taken, it should be taken for long duration.

I would just call it according to a personal whim and say "Jags." Just my "feeling," I'm not sure many so-called experts could do much better this season.........

need a speech on customer appreciation. any ideas where to look?   How long does the speech need to be? You should be able to write something up fairly easily if you have any business background. Customers are the cornerstone of virtually any business. Perhaps you should start with a quotation of some sort that summarizes customer appreciation and go from there. Google for quote sites and then type in "customer appreciation." Pick a quote that has meaning for you and then build something around it. Think about your audience...and gear the speech toward them. There is no one size fits all speech...the best ones come from your heart (but are edited with your mind).

Why do you like marketing? What is it you like about studying or working in marketing, or just marketing in general?\n\nIs there anything you don't like? Nothing happens until something is sold. Marketing is the means by which things are sold. Some people confuse marketing and sales. Sales is part of marketing and the sale is the ultimate goal, but they are different. Marketing involves all the psychology and attributes needed to get a product or service to the market and into the consumers hands. It is probably the most important part of business. Marketing involves research, advertising and sales. Most of your top executives come from a marketing background.

Women have breasts and nipples and has a purpose - why should men have the same in a different version? Every one understands the purpose behind the nipples of a woman - to feed the child., But what is the use and purpsoe of a similar ones in men? Is there any scientific reason or use of them? Nature is lazy, just that simple.  It is easier to have the same structure in both men and women (since any such structure has to be written in the DNA, then there is no need for different DNA) and simply have it activated by the few genes that control sex hormones at puberty.\nSuppose that men did not have nipple, then the DNA for NOT having nipple would have to be on the Y chromosome than only men have; and the DNA for describing the nipple would have to be on the X chromosome, but men have ONE X chromosome. The only way to have that would be to have extra code to erase nipples on the Y chromosome, to balance the "have nipple" on the X. uch too complicated.  Mother nature likes things to be simpler.\nSo men walk around with unneeded body parts.

whats the prime factorization of 100?   Divide 100 into 2 numbers, for instance 50 and 2. Write those down. 2 is a prime number, so cannot be divided further. Divide 50 into 2 numbers. Write down all the prime numbers you have. You should end up with 5 x 5 x 2 x 2 for your final answer. If you multiply these prime numbers together, you get 100! Do similar problems the same way.

Holyfield won! Can you believe it? Won a decision. Dropped Oquendo in the first round. This is a significant win. I remember watching Fres Oquendo box Chris Byrd, the judges gave the win to Byrd but it was clear to me that Oquendo was the victor so I think he is a better fighter than people give him credit for. I wish Hollyfield the best. I'd like to see him retire before he gets permanent damage but anytime he is in the ring I'm rooting for him!!! He is still the Real Deal.
how can you be nice to someone who's very arrogant? becarefull his your boss! Good question weng! Its very hard, but let it go over your head. The fact that he is your boss makes it difficult. Try to feel sorry for him that he is so insecure that he has to be arrogant. We cant like everyone all of the time. Dont make it a problem for yourself, its his problem let him get on with it. Just do your job and be polite, dont a*s e lick, just be yourself.... Your boss will probably appreciate that more.  Get to know what makes him tick and concentrate on that. If he does or says anything you dont like just be assertive without being rude. Its not what you say but how you say it that matters!  I hope that you are happy in your job. If your boss affects your happiness in your work, then it may be best that you look for another job.  I hope it does not come to that stage. Try not to let his arrogance get to you, alot of people are like this.
What did people do for pornography before photography was invented?   Painting / sketches, burlesque shows, erotic fiction, etc.  A lot of what we read about that we don't pay attention to (risque poetry, etc.) would have been considered very dirty when it was written. \n\nI'd dare say, though, that people used their imaginations a lot more than we do today.  They certainly weren't any less horny, even if they were more restrained in some cultures (not all, though -- ancient Romans, for example, were pretty perverted.)
He left me when i was pregnant and went and married someone else and had children.comment please?   Take him to court for child support and yes you are going to be involed in this man and his wife for 18  years and make the best out of it.  Make sure you get sole custody, since he did make sure that you were just the score to get sex and no relationship, he can alos try to get your child.  Men are out to get one thing and that is sex,and he does not care about the factors of your feelings or respect.  If women just say no, and stop making it so easy for men to robbed us from our bodies and etc.  We wil get more respect then we got.  Unfortunately to many women are not using thier brains, and keeping the legs close and just say and mean NO!  You were used, just like so many other women.  Don't make it easy for a man to use you just for sex!
Count your blessings...? Name them one by one. I asked God for strength that I might achieve. I was made weak that I might learn humbly to obey. I asked for health that I might do greater things. I was given infirmity that I might do better things. I asked for riches that I might be happy. I was given poverty that I might be wise. I asked for power that I might have the praise of men. I was given weakness that I might feel the need of God. I asked for all things that I might enjoy life. I was given life that I might enjoy all things. I got nothing that I asked for, but everything I hoped for. Almost despite myself, my unspoken prayers were answered. I am, among all men, most richly BLESSED.

Opinion of DB-125 Galileo Dobsonian 100x135mm telescope? My 12 year old son has asked for a telescope for christmas.  I'm happy to support his interest in science / astrology.\n\nI know he's a beginner but I'd rather spend $200 on something that will be worthwhile, than $100 on a piece of junk that he can't see anything with and is only frustrating to him.\n\nI saw what seems to be a nice telescope at a BJ's warehouse.\n\nIt's a Galileo with a sturdy cherry Dobsonian base.\n\nClick on this link to see what it looks like, only it's a DB-125 and it's $200.\n\nhttp://www.galileosplace.com/Telescopes/Reflector_Telescopes/DB-135.html\n\nSpecs on the box say:  \n\n1100 x 135mm telescope\n1.25 10mm & 25mm eyepieces\nElectronic finderscope\ncherrywood base \n\nI am attracted to the sturdy base which is not a flimsy tripod like they usually are.  However, I'm concerned that it might be too heavy...\n\nand i'm not sure anyway, how one uses a telescope....  do you carry it outside everytime?  What if u have trees?\n\nAny advice for me?\n\nThanks the quality sounds questionable. In my opinion you should get an orion xt6 or an orion short tube 80 with the eq-1 equatorial mount
downloading movie thing/? what is the thing that you can download movies alot faster and easier. I have Limewire, but there is something else my friend has it and I forgot what it was. First, I won't go into the legality of downloading movies. There are copyright laws in the US that would make downloading movies a crime. Actually, I don't know if it's the act of DOWNLOADING or the act of UPLOADING or MAKING AVAILABLE that is illegal. I would think the later.\n\nAnyway, you can find tons of movies at various BitTorrent sites. I use these as a few to find certain TV shows...\n\nhttp://www.torrentspy.com/\nhttp://isohunt.com/\nhttp://isohunt.com/\nhttp://thepiratebay.org/\n\nYou'll need a BitTorrent client to download these files. I use Azureus, which seems to be about the best. You can find it for free, here....\n\nhttp://azureus.sourceforge.net/\n\nFinally, there are pay sites that make promises that I cannot attest to, because I have never used them, but they might be worth a look. Here are a few...\n\nhttp://watersaffl.pspblend.hop.clickbank.net?tid=YAHOOANS\nhttp://watersaffl.movies01.hop.clickbank.net?tid=YAHOOANS\nhttp://watersaffl.sharedm.hop.clickbank.net?tid=YAHOOANS\nhttp://watersaffl.tvorg.hop.clickbank.net?tid=YAHOOANS\nhttp://watersaffl.flynetwork.hop.clickbank.net?tid=YAHOOANS\n\nThat ought to do you for a while. Good luck.

Dating older men with children part 2? we live together.they visit monthly for a weekend.we always do things together with them,go for lunch,dinner,movies,shopping,\ni bake cakes for them.i'm doing what comes naturally when i like or care for someone.i'm very busy as well doing my law degree and for me to take time off of my studies and put my assignments on hold to spend time with them is not buying affection.i dont need to.i wont always have time to do things with them when they are around so i dont want to be persecuted for it if i dont join them for dinner or go out with them when i've got piles of assignments and reading to do not to mention my own problems i have to deal with which my partner is aware of and should be supportive of me and not for him and his kids to put more pressure on me.they seem to make biased judgements about me.there's always two sides to every story but they dont care to hear mine.no one is perfect.a saying goes,if you disrespect or offend a man,you do the same to his woman,and vice versa. okay, you obviously have not had any children of your own yet.  What exactly is the age difference between you and his children?  15 is pretty old.  a 15 year old is no longer a child and they have already formed opinions of their own and could very possibly support themselves if ever needed.  So a 15 year old is a young adult.  My brother is 15.  Its a very delicate stage where they want their parents undivided attention, and they are old enough to know how to get it....His daughter IS "HIS daughter" and has been in his life from day one for 15 years.  He undoughtably loves her, and fathers allow their daughters to manipulate them, even more than their sons for the most part.  This girl may feel as though you are her equal (if you are close in age with her) inturn she will not respect you...@ 15 sometimes you don't even respect your parents let alone the chick your dad's dating.....He is going to take her (and the other children's) side over yours every time, probably forever, if he stays with you....i know this sounds harsh, and it is not meant to offend but I'm just telling you how it is.  And I'm 100% sure it has nothing to do with your race @ all.

Question-Stress/Strain/Modulus? I'm stuck--can anyone help? Thanks in advance. \n\nThe total cross-sectional area of the load-bearing calcified portion of the two forearm bones (radius and ulna) is approximately 2.2 cm^2. During a car crash, the forearm is slammed against the dashboard. The arm comes to reast from an initial speed of 80 km/hr in .0047 sec. If the arm has an effective mass of 3.0 kg, what is the compressional stress that the arm withstands during the crash? Assume the forearm is pointed straight forward, so the force is directed along its long axis. Calculate the force on the arm from F=ma, with m 3.0kg, and a the acceleration 80kph/.0047sec (fix the units so it's all m/sec first). Then you have the force, and you have the cross-sectional area that's bearing that load, so F/A=P to get the pressure or stress. Maybe divide by two if there's two bones.
Had a bad employer now scared to accept any job offers what to do? I have a great job now, but unfortunatly it is a temp job and is ending in a few months. I was so scared to accept the job i'm in now because of my previous employer. I had a horrible employer before the job i'm in now. They treated me badly and just shot my self confidence down. The company I was at had a horrible newer employee that treated me like crap, I would tell the boss how I was treated and what the person did and what they lied about (she tried to get me in trouble a few times) the boss always took the other person's side of the story. (though i was at the compnay longer than this new girl)\nThe boss was horrible. She was rude and mean and I never felt once that she backed my decision and work...though I did great work and was complemented about once or twice during the year I was there. I just had such a horrible exp. thier, I am terrified now of accepting any job...I'm scared it will turn out to be as horrible at that job. The ppl were terrible there, down rite mean... When you work for a tyrant it is demoralizing, demeaning, and it can damage your self esteem beyond repair.  I feel for you--and I am in the same boat.\nI can only tell you to do what I haven't yet done myself.  Move on.  Take a new job and hopefully you will be able to work for people that appreciate you.
for women only please? Has anyone ever had puss come out of thier belly button? Even without any surgeries or anything?? If so what have you done about it? I hate doctors sometimes. Make the effort to go somewhere else and get a second opinion. I've never had this, but whatever it is it needs to be treated. Don't let this go, because it may be something serious, rare, or new...
i just purchased a Remington 710 and am in need of a scope. any reccomendations? my budget is 125$ or less, tx looking for a scope to fit this model, something that is strong, durable and provides me with visual distance Forget Tasco!!  I have a Nikon on my Browning A-bolt and it is just fine.  I normally prefer Leupold, but I got the Nikon with a rebate and on sale.  I think unless you really shop around, your going to have a hard time finding a dependable scope to take the punishment for $125.  Learn to shoot your iron sights well and wait until after the season for some sales.
How do you develop critical thinking skills?   There are lots of books on critical thinking. If you are asking this on behalf of a child, start out easy, and buy critical thinking work books, like 1st grade, and work his/her way up. If you are asking on behalf of yourself, buy books on the subject from Barnes and Noble or Costco. They seem to carry the best ones. Buy more than just one book, so you can develop more and more sides of the skill. .Buy an SAT prep book from the College Board, (about $17) and read the critical reading sections. Answer the questions after. You'll get better at reading critically as you do it more.\n\nHope this helps!
How do I approach my wife about either adding another woman or going to see another woman by myself? I just need some helpful suggestions here, please no moralistic preaching. Oh yes my friend you are so lucky I have bumped into your question. I have dedicated countless scientific hours to the study of this and I am happy to inform you that I have succeeded.\nTHere are several aproaches you can take but first you need to find out why you want to do this?\na) is it just a sexual thing?\nb) is it that you want to incorporate a second wife into the family dinamycs?\nWhat exactly are you feeling?\nKnow that this is not a quick process, it will take you months if not years to work on her in order to agree to this and even then it may not happen ever.\nWith that said lets get to it.\nIf its the sexual thing then it will be a lot easier than you think, its not that hard to get a woman to agree to it, now the realtionship part that one will be a tought one but let me assure you that it can be done, I have done it and it works out great for all of us. I will tell you buddy that its not an easy life but the rewards are worth it to me.\n1- you need to prepare the grownd. Be very affectionate, be helpfull, you need to give in order to receive, you will have to become a pleaser. ie. breakfast in bed, do dishes, make sure she enjoys sex very much, compliments, flowers, etc.\n2-Avoid fights. dont get into it with her, make problems look like a thing of the past. If there is a disagreement or situation you talk about it in a civil manner, no name calling, no yelling. Be very understanding of the situation and her feelings, make consecions and move on, dont bring up the past no matter what, if you fail to do this you will be taking a few steps back.\n3-connect with her. make sure you reach a transendent connection with her, be more aware of her feelings and thoughts on many topics. Make sure you make time and place to talk to her, to discuss different things other than her job or friends, focus on HER and only HER.\n4-If you have children be more affectionate with the children and more involved with them, dont' dump them on her or expect her to take care of them, cook breakfast for them on a sat morning and take them to the park so she can sleep in and have some alone time.\n\nThis process could take anything between a month and a year tops but you will see some dramatic changes.\nAt some point she will start doing more stuff for you, asking you how you are, cooking you up stuff you like, etc. THis is her way of reciprocating. If she doesn't there will be a point in which you feel like you need to say something because you will feel neglected, ok when this happens RESIST, deal with it and continue doing your part. THen the second time you feel like you are going to explode say something, but remember NO YELLING AND NO FIGHTING ( that is the golden rule here),she will ask you what she could do and just say that you want her to show you as well that she cares and loves you, don't say anything about a 3some, dont even hint it. Then give her a cpl days, she will spend this time thinking what she can do to make it up to you, at this point you have a conversation about things you would like her to do but still don't bring up the other woman thing, wait. She will try to do this things, more than likely she will screw it up so you will have another conversation about it, again remember to be very civil about this, dont fight no matter what.\nNow you are ready to make a move; if its for a simple sexual expirerience ask her during or right after sex: how she would feel about having sex with another woman? and just listen, she will at some point ask you why? or what you think? either way your response will be that she is so sexy and she would look so much sexier having sex with another woman, the kissing, the touching, etc. Reasure her that she is the only woman in your life and you love her so much. THen all of the sudden kiss her and get down dirty to having sex again, but this time it has to be passionate, animal, porno kind of sex. She will make a coment about it and tell her that just picturing it in your
Have you seen 'V for Vendetta'? What a strange little film....\nEnjoyed it though... yes it was a little odd but it was very interesting. i stayed awake for the whole movie and that is unusual for me!
free movie downloads? do you know a link that i could download free movies? There is one that is legal that you can find a few free movies, but charge small charges to rent or buy the majority of them. They will also have these promotions sometimes where you can rent movies on some weekends for 1.99 or less. I really like the site, it has a lot of good movies on it.\n\nwww.movielink.com\n\nThere are a few others too, but I can't remember them at the moment. Google "downloading movies" and look around for different sites. Google will show you a lot of them.
Were can I find a company or mortgage broker that can find or finance small Commercial and Multi Family loans? I am currently in the market to buy a five unit multi-family property listed  at $180,000. Because it is considered a commercial property I’m having a hard time finding a lender that does commercial loans under $500,000. I should be able to put 20% down by drawing equity out of another propriety so I don’t foresee there being a problem financing it. I would appreciate any suggestions. I do this type of loan. Please email with some of the detail\nat JohnG@oldmerchants.com
Couples with mono? My boyfriend was diagnosed with mono about 2 weeks ago via blood test, but he was showing symptoms earlier.  I was tested a week ago and came up negative for mono.  I'm still feeling very nervous about mono and am wondering whats the likelihood of me contracting mono from him.  (i.e. is there a tendency for couples to get it around the same time??) Did i get tested too early?  I'm really scared. If you don't have any symptoms still then you probably dodged that bullet.  You may as well get tested again anyway.

Jealous cousin or girlfriend...? Recently I added a question regarding my cousin who's so open minded till we have sex... anyway, on saturday, a girl friend of mine came over to my house to stay due to some of her family problem. My mum and cousin shared the same room while the other, which my sis room, was locked as she went overseas. (She also dun like sharing room with others) So she (my friend) shared the same room with me. However, she and I sleep separately and DID NOT do anything. =D My cousin, who's also consider my gf, without people knowing, was jealous. This morning after my bathing, she was hugging very tight to me and did not want me to leave for work in my room of course. And I had my towels on only. She said she was jealous as she can't sleep with me while my girl friend can. What should I do to please her? Sleep with her? I mean sleeping over night. but my parents can't know of it... I think you and your cousin need to go to therapy because there is something just a little wrong about sleeping together in any manner of the word. You need to go out and find a real love interest and not worry about your cousin, she needs to go look for someone across town, not across the hall. That's just skeezy.

Maybe play Q over Thomas (Kurt or Kenny?  Kenny's not gonna be scoring much this season, and Kurt will not play significant minutes when Amare gets healthier).  I wish my own starting lineup was that strong though.

what side of the issue of animal cloning has the media come out on most often?   I wouldn't say they generally come out on either side.  They really don't understand cloning, and as such tend to simply report the facts as they have heard them.  When you consider that the great bulk of the population doesn't really even know what cloning means, you can understand why.

ashworth college? i received my associate  degree in criminal justice,i cant find a job that would take my degree in the state that i live in This is from the Ashworth College web site:\nAshworth College is nationally accredited by the Accrediting Commission of the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC), which is listed by the U.S. Department of Education as a nationally recognized accrediting agency for distance learning schools\n\nI have always advised students to earn their degrees from a college that is regionally accredited and, based on their web site, Ashworth College apparently is not. Regional accreditation is the most accepted type of accreditation. You can read more about this at http://distancelearn.about.com/od/accreditationinfo/a/regional.htm\n\nI would suggest that you get in touch with an adviser or counselor at Ashworth to see if they can help you get a job.\n\ns
Penalty minutes in fantasy hockey? I'm in a Rotisserie league and wondering if I would be better off with a D man that has more PIM's?\n\nLike an idiot I took Joni Pitaken (he was so good last year) and this year he is Joni Pitiful.  I could get someone like Witt who has lots more PIMs, less assists (3 vs 8) still no goals, but is a plus 3 vs Pitiful's -10.\n\nI'm never sure how to evaluate in fantasy.\n\nAny suggestions?  I would hang in with Joni, but let's face it the Flyers are in big trouble--if precedent follows the second I dump Joni he'll score goals and jump up high in the rankings.\n\nNot a huge Islander fan but Nolan will have these guys scrapping and playing better than Philly, don't cha think?\n\nThanks for any help you can offer! Just make sure his PIM's do not off-set his other statistics (Goals, Assists, +/-).  Those are all important as well in a Rotisserie League.  If you can get a defenseman that is balance in all these categories then you are set.  If a defenseman spends too much time getting PIM and not helping you in other categories, then he's not that valuable.

how much is the fee if you overstay in the philippines?   Immigration violations are taken very seriously in the Philippines. Every year, dozens of foreigners pay fines and are put in Immigration detention for breaking the law. Visa regulations in the Philippines change often – be sure to check the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) website at www.dfa.gov.ph frequently for updates. Visitors U.S. citizens do not need a visa to enter the Philippines for stays of less than 21 days. Visitors coming to the Philippines on the no-visa policy must enter for tourism purposes, have a passport valid for six-months beyond their estimated stay and present proof of onward travel.ention.ivileges.\nTemporary Residents If the intended stay is over 21 days, a visa is required. Currently, 21-day visas can be extended to 59 days for 2,020 pesos. Visa extensions can be made at the Bureau of Immigration in Manila or at a regional office. If avisitor overstays their temporary visa, they may have to pay a fine of 1,000 pesos. Failure to pay the fine may result in detPermanent Residents There are many types of visas for permanent residents. \nThe non-quota types are similar to U.S. family based categories. For example, spouses of Philippine citizens are eligible for a 13-a visa, which will give the holder a green card status. The Special Resident Retiree’s Visa (SRRV) is also available, but has age andfinancial requirements. The SRRV is advantageous because the holder receives a permanent non-immigrant status with multiple entry prYour Visa is a very important document.

Are all fish fins considered Kosher? E. G. if a shark would have kosher scales would its fins disqualify it? I would imagine that the shark's fins are not actually a kosher sign because they resemble limbs. They are completely unlike the fins seen on small fish that are commonly eaten such as herring, sardines, and salmon.\nIn this vein, what are the fins of a tuna fish subset like? do they resemble a salmon's or a shark's? Varies from both.

He didn't stop you.  So...  I guess he let you know it didn't bother him.  If you want to find out, go for it and let him know you want to play with his business.  Then you'll know.

And he that thirsteth, let him come: and he that will, let him take the water of life, freely. 18 For I testify to every one that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book: If any man shall add to these things, God shall add unto him the plagues written in this book. 19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from these things that are written in this book. 20 He that giveth testimony of these things, saith, Surely I come quickly: Amen. Come, Lord Jesus. \n\n21 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
is it true if you have a full blatter and someone punches you in the stomache you die?

How do I check farther than last week on history?   That might be as far as your history holds..a way to make it hold more time is to go to TOOLS and then INTERNET OPTIONS...then near the bottom it will say DAYS TO KEEP ITEMS IN HISTORY..make that as long as you want..i think you can go up to 99 days which is plenty for your history
Is the Glock 27 the current most popular handgun, or Taurus 40.cal? I'm thinking about buying something new...any input about either of these, or something else?\nI'd want to stay in the 40 cal range...but what brand has the most reliability and ease of use...home defence.\nbudget is around 500 at the moment. Find a range that rents .... always try before you buy ...Glocks are preferred by law enforcement because of the integrated trigger and grip safety ... in short there isn't really a safety if you grip the gun with your finger on the trigger ....because of this there have been alot of accidental shootings .... Why do you want the weapon.....do you have a need to draw and fire quickly (like a cop on a traffic stop) then yes the Glock .... There were shooting incidents where law enforcement forgot to take the safety off ... that's why the Glock is so popular ..there is not lever or button to press the fire ..just grip & go....\n\nI have the seperate safety ... I hate the accidental discharge potential of a weapon I carry on my person..... I prefer to think before I fire.\n\nBut to each his own......\n\nYou do test drive a car before your buy onw right ..... when you invest the money in something for self defence you should know how it works and handles before you take it home!\n\nHappy Huntin'
gas question for chem? At 0°C a 1.00 L flask contains 1.80  10-2 mol N2, 4.80  102 mg O2, and NO at a concentration of 9.00  1018 molecules/cm3. What is the partial pressure of each gas, and what is the total pressure in the flask?\nplease explain Partial pressure:  For each gas assume that it is alone in the volume V at the temperature T.  Use P = nRT/V where n are the moles of each specific gas.\n\nThe total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures.
Do Christians recognize as legitimate marriages performed by non-Christian clergy? Sure, it's before "G*d," but WHICH ONE? They do. Back in the day, they would not have, since the Church was the only place you were allowed to get married, but alas, those days have passed.\nAnyway, nowadays, no matter WHO marries you, as long as they are recognized by the STATE in which you get married, it's considered a legitimate marriage.\nAlthough I think you're asking more along the lines of would they recognize and accept it? Some would, since the person who performed the marriage has to be legally licensed to do so. Some would NOT because they were not married in the eyes of God. They, in my opinion, are wrong. When two people love each other, yes, they can make that love whole by getting married, but if it's not in the Christian church, it shouldn't be a big deal.

what are the properties of convalent,ionic,and matallic bonds?   COVALENT\nValence electrons are shared between adjacent atoms.  \nHighly directional bonds produce molecules rather than crystals.\nAlmost all polymers exhibit this, as do diamond and silicon carbide (unusual ceramics).\n\nIONIC\nMetallic element gives up valence electrons to nonmetallic element.\nTends to produce the crystalline structures we call ceramics.\nVery strong bonds --> high melting points, elastic moduli.\nImparts hardness, brittleness and insulativity.\n\nMETALLIC\nInvolves “free-roaming” valence electrons.\nTends to produce the crystalline structures we call metals.\nImparts conductivity, ductility/malleability, opacity and reflectivity.
What kind of telescope would really take advantage of a Meade LPI Camera? What about a 5" 1020 mm one? with at least 80mm aperture? A 5" telescope has 5" of aperture. \n\nThe quick answer is, a large telescope would take advantage of the Meade LPI Camera. The camera has an effective magnfication somewhere in the range of an eyepeice that's 6mm in focal length, which means it's high magnification. The larger the telescope is in aperture, the higher the "resolution" which means you will be able to obtain better images with high magnification eyepieces.\n\nThat being said, your decision should ultimatly be based on your price range and what type of objects you'd prefer to image and view. An 80mm apochromatic refractor is a nice little quality telescope which will give nice (albeit small) images of planets and using a camera on it such as the Meade LPI will give you nice images, even of things you can barely see, as long as you have the proper mount. 80mm is rather small though and a larger telescope will allow you to be more versitile in your viewing. A lot of people are content with 8" Schmidt Cassegrains as an all around scope.
How many ball bearings are in the freewheel part of the hub on a 26" shimano mountain bike? There are loose ball bearings in the freewheel part of a mountain bike. Does anyone know how many go in there? I disassembled 2 mountain bikes to make an electric bike. Now i am putting one back together and i have 2 sets but i lost some from each set and it leaves me with no clue. These are the bearing underneath the shimano freewheel locking nut... the bearing are loose under there. Thank you! ok this is simple. ive taken apart a few shimano hubs and they have had either 9 or 11 ball bearings on each side.\n\neasy way to figure out how many: \n-have a tray of grease on hand\n-lay on some grease in the area were the bearings go\n-dip each ball into the grease and use tweezers to put them in place\n-only a certain amount will fit into the bearing race\n-put the axle back through when ur done and see if it rotates smoothly\n\ngood luck

Has anyone ever tried the GI (glycemic index) diet, and did it work? I was wondering if the GI diet works.  It looks like a very good diet to follow, but I don't want to start it if it does not give me results. The glycemic index is about foods high in carbohydrates. Foods high in fat or protein don't cause your blood glucose level to rise much.  The glycemic index is about the quality of the carbohydrates, not the quantity.  It lets you know what you should eat to keep you blood sugar more stable and body more healthy\n\nThe basic technique for eating the low GI way is simply a "this for that" approach - ie, swapping high GI carbs for low GI carbs. You don't need to count numbers or do any sort of mental arithmetic to make sure you are eating a healthy, low GI diet.\n\n    * Use breakfast cereals based on oats, barley and bran\n    * Use breads with wholegrains, stone-ground flour, sour dough\n    * Reduce the amount of potatoes you eat\n    * Enjoy all other types of fruit and vegetables\n    * Use Basmati or Doongara rice\n    * Enjoy pasta, noodles, quinoa\n    * Eat plenty of salad vegetables with a vinaigrette dressing\n.

Can anybodu describe me what kind of job does andragogist do? i would like to hear the description of job that adult educator (andragogist) do Several European countries, such as Hungary, Poland, and Yugoslavia, use the term andragogy to mean adult education.\n\nThe term has come to refer to self-directed learning.\n\nAdults, being independant, having  life experience, and having the motivation, are prime candidates for the andragogical approach to teaching and learning.\n\nPedagogy is teacher-directed teaching. \n\nAndrogogy is facilitating learner-directed learning.\n\nKnowles suggested that adult educators should:\n\n    * set a cooperative learning climate\n    * create mechanisms for mutual planning\n    * arrange for a diagnosis of learner needs and interests\n    * enable the formulation of learning objectives based on the diagnosed needs and interests\n    * design sequential activities for achieving the objectives\n    * execute the design by selecting methods, materials, and resources; and\n    * evaluate the quality of the learning experience while rediagnosing needs for further learning\n\nInitially defined as, "the art and science of helping adults learn," andragogy has come to be understood as an alternative to pedagogy; a learner-focused approach for people of all ages.\n\nJOB DESCRIPTION:\nAndragogists  provide instruction in a wide variety of subjects that students take for personal enrichment or self-improvement. Some teach a series of classes that provide students with useful life skills, such as cooking, personal finance, and time management classes. Others provide group instruction intended solely for recreation, such as photography, pottery, and painting courses. Many others provide one-on-one instruction in a variety of subjects, including dance, singing, or playing a musical instrument. The instruction andragogists  provide seldom leads to a particular degree and attendance is voluntary, but dedicated, talented students sometimes go on to careers in the arts. Teachers who conduct courses on academic subjects in a non-academic setting, such as literature, foreign language, and history courses, are also included in this occupation.\n\nAndragogists  provide instruction on a wide range of subjects, so they may have styles and methods of instruction that differ greatly. Most self-enrichment classes are relatively informal and not demanding of andragogists . Some classes, such as pottery or sewing, may be largely hands-on, with the andragogists demonstrating methods or techniques for the class, observing students as they attempt to do it themselves, and pointing out mistakes to students and offering suggestions to improve techniques. Other classes, such as those involving financial planning or religion and spirituality, may rely heavily on group discussions. Andragogists  may also teach classes offered through religious institutions, such as marriage preparation or classes in religion for children.\n\nMany of the classes that andragogists  teach are shorter in duration than classes taken for academic credit; some finish in 1 or 2 days to several weeks. These brief classes tend to be introductory in nature and generally focus on only one topic—for example, a cooking class that teaches students how to make bread. Some self-enrichment classes introduce children and youths to activities such as piano or drama, and may be designed to last anywhere from 1 week to several months.\n\nMany andragogists  provide one-on-one lessons to students. The instructor may only work with the student for an hour or two a week, but direct the student what they should practice in the interim until their next lesson. Many andragogists work with the same students on a weekly basis for years and derive satisfaction from observing them mature and gain expertise. The most talented students may go on to paid careers as craft artists, painters, sculptors, dancers, singers, or musicians.\n\nAll andragogists must prepare lessons beforehand and stay current in their fields. Many andragogists  are self employed and provide instruction as a business. As such, they must col

How do I import a product from another country? If I want to import a product from another country... what steps should I take? What are the basics of importation? Where places do I need to visit? Who do I have to speak with? Dear Sir,I don't know in which country you live in,but overall the definitions are very the same.Of course,first you need to be signed in as an importer (see your government rules),then you specify the product:from which country,...then you get in touch with the exporter and ask for brochures,terms of delivery,prices,quality standards,....to find suppliers in Europe,you can search www.europages.com and look for products.Addresses are available on line. You can use search engines also (google,yahoo,...).Do not forget to ask important information about VAT,and all other costs involved (shipping,packaging,...).Look around for courses you can follow or get involved in on line business clubs, such as Linked In,Open BC,and so on.Ask your government for more information if necessary,or contact a lawyer specialized in export insurance. It's not easy,but you can open an on line store and sell without having a warehouse. Try it out,look for possibilities. I wish you luck.\nGreetings,\nLuc

pulled muscle? my mum has just pulled a muscle washing her hair, its down her left side, she is in pain and it's taking her breath away? what could this be? should she see a doctor? If it's confirmed that this is a pulled muscle, go out quickly and buy a tube of arnica gel, preferably A.Vogel or Roberts. These are the ones available at health shops and better chemists. I don't find the Weleda so effective. \n\nAs you rub it in to the pulled muscle the skin feels very cold and within five minutes there is quite a dramatic reduction of pain. Keep massaging it in a few times a day and the pain will go quicker than if arnica not used. Arnica gel is used by physios on sports injuries to muscles.

Search "Emperor Constantine/Christianity" You should find all you need there. Any Catholic site will only give you their "sanitized" version of what was happening.

Who will win the 2006 Ashes and why? Who or what strategy will bring their country to glory? I think it will be a tough and gritty series for both teams. Having said that, England will be suffering for the lack of Simon Jones and Michael Vaughan, who were both key players last time. Also, the late loss of Tresco will damage their chances. Australia is a tough tour, and the hard pitches have a habit of taking their toll on visiting bowlers. Harmison and Flintoff are both recovering from injuries, but will need to bowl long spells which could take their toll.\nHowever, the England team are young and enthusiastic, which will give them plenty of determination. They also have plenty of talent in KP, Flintoff, Strauss etc.\nAustralia though, I feel, have just too much experience. Yourself, and Hayden, when you two get going build awesome platforms for the team to go onto big totals. Punter is in the best form of his life and has scored 1483 runs at 78 including 8 tons since the Ashes. If he gets going, We should be scoring 500+ scores. Then Hussey, well what a talent. Marto has a doubt but with Clarke and Jacques both pressing for a spot the middle should fire more than last year. Gilchrist doesn't even need a mention, except to say that Englands strategy of bowling around the wicket and moving it away shouldn't work as well in Oz as the extra bounce should give his the chance to cut and pull more often, which we all know he does with devestating effect. Brett Lee, McGrath and Warney will all fire up and do the job, and whoever gets the nod out of Watson, Clark, Tait or Johnson will be very keen to impress, and with the benefit of the extra bounce at home, the youngsters should bowl fast, and make life tough for England's inexperienced batsmen.\nI think it will be closer than a lot of people back home will be thinking. I think the home crowds, and the conditions will just be a little too much for such a young inexperienced England team. Don't worry, there are plenty of Aussies over here in London who will be sitting up late at night and cheering you boys along, and we are taking the stick from the Poms for you, so get stuck in, good luck, and here's to a summer of runs for you boys.\nAus to win 2-1.

Today, (11/14/2006), my teacher gave the whole class a "confidence lecture" because we weren't performing so well.\n\nHe told us that you will get nowhere in life unless you be assertive and aggressive (NOT violent), and I believe that is true.\n - You have to move people out of the way, and not let them move you.\n - Don't stand in the corner, be the center of the party.\n\nHe also told us that high school only comes once, and after four years of the 'intense drama', you probably might not even see those people again.\n - Make the best of your four years (or more).\n - Don't make a big deal about labels: be yourself.\n\nI'm only a freshman now, but his sermon got me thinking...\nAfter high school:\n - Where will I go?\n - Who will I be with?\n - Why my life turned out that way\n - etc.\n\n"I've heard it said that people come into our lives for a reason, bringing something we must learn; And we are led to those who help us most to grow if we let them, and we help them in return.  Well, I don't know if I believe that's true; But I know I'm who I am today because I knew you."\n          - Stephen Schwartz ("For Good" from Wicked)
Love Advice? I've answered many questions concerning love tonight, & now I have my own quesion...again. If you were a 7th grade boy who is in love with a 7th grade girl & you knew the girl was in love with you but never told you & she was your best friend & you go nervous whenever you wanted to ask her about her feelings for you even at perfect opertunities *Big inhale* what would you do?\n\nPS, the girl knows you love her. umm, me being a girl my self, i would wait for the person to make the first move. belive me, most girls wait for the guy.
On line classes? I got my BA in Liberal Arts, and I am thinking to get into health care field, so I need to take some science classes, such as chemistry, biology, physiology and anatomy. Does anyone out there know any of these classes are offered online from an accredited university? I had checked on these with two university's.  Both said that you have to do in class work to learn quite a bit of it and that unfortunately cannot be done safely on line.

Do you think people use satan as a way to not feel responsible for their own actions? I know not every christian thinks this way, but do you think that many of the ideas behind satan were created to make it easy for a person to forgive their own sins? I sure do, especially when they make excuses. I read an answer here on that neocon pastor and his male prostitute: "The closer to God you are, the more the devil tries to get you" or something like that. Anyone not a Christian who does the same is just evil to them, but when it's a Christian, they point at the devil.

Is this true??? (GUYS ONLY)? Ive heard that guys DO NOT talk in the washroom or make any eye contact???\nIs this true? and if so...WHY NOT???? what could happen if you make polite eye contact or talk???? Its true, for the most part.\n\nProbably nothing, but people might think you were gay.\n\nKeep in mind, guys talk a lot less then girls in general, so we find it pretty easy not to talk for the 30 seconds we're holding our equipment.

what does a.m and p.m mean?   if I remember right p.m stands for post meridian or prime meridian and a.m stands for ante meridian.  Don't quote me on it though.  I will check to make sure  but I'm pretty sure these are the meanings.  Ante is actually how it is spelled  because it's origination is Latin
Why is it believed that force is the cause of motion,How does that compare to Einstein's law of motion?   f=ma\n1st thing is it Einstein's law of motion or new ton's any way:\n\nwe kw that\na=v/t^2\n\nand E=mc^2\n\nc is velocity~~ square of speed of light\n\nnw compare the two!\n\nwithout any source of force there is absolutely no motion!\nbut a substance suppressing or stoping motion occurs when an equal and opposite force is applied!
Has this happened to you? I just got an from a forum member about "our boycott" working, because Walmart has dropped its gay and lesbian agenda.  He was referring to a post I had left in response to a question asking if I used my buying power to assert my views with stores that either supported or didn't support my beliefs.  I said I certainly did, and I won't be shopping at Walmart through the holidays.\n\nThis is because I'm Wiccan and Walmart has decided that "Happy Holidays" is somehow less appropriate than "Merry Christmas", which excludes the MYRIAD of other holidays occurring in December.  I have no problem with Christmas, but it's not the only holiday happening in the next few weeks.\n\nSo, how many posters on this site genuinely believe that only Christians, Athiests and Muslims post and answer questions here?  Because I'm noticing a trend not only in responses but in questions I'm seeing.  Do the rest of us not count?  By a show of hands? I tend to argue on the side of Atheists but I completely understand how you feel. I try not to bring up Wicca because of the torrent of abuse it generally brings out from the Christian population. Though, oddly, the Atheists and the Muslims are much much nicer than the Christians.
I'm a Filipino citizen with a Resident visa to australia,is a US Visa still needed to go to the states? hi! my husband and  I just received our resident visa to Australia but still holders of a Philippine passport, we're planning to go the United States before we start our Australian residency. Do you guys think we still need to apply for a US Visa? Unless Australia and the United States united into a single nation since last night, yes you need to get a seperate visa to visit here.
Need gov. grant advice? Does anyone have experience with getting a government grant to start their own business?  need advice. You stand a greater chance of getting a government-guaranteed loan through the Small Business Administration http://www.sba.gov/financing than a government grant. Read the SBA Financing page to learn about criteria needed for borrowing \n\nIt is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on "how to get grants" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html\n\n"The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."\n\nHere is a listing of federal grants for small businesses. See if there is any available for individuals for starting a business -- THERE'S NONE.\nhttp://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALOG.BROWSE_BENEF_RPT.show\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nI suggest you read the following books to get ideas of how to finance your business:\n\nFinancing Your Small Business  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1572484500/powerhomebizguid\nSmall Business Financing: How and Where To Get It http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0808007386/powerhomebizguid\nFinancing the Small Business: A Complete Guide to Obtaining Bank Loans and All Other Types of Financing http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1580626815/powerhomebizguid\nThe SBA Loan Book http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/158062202X/powerhomebizguid\nAngel Capital : How to Raise Early-Stage Private Equity Financing http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471690635/powerhomebizguid\nFinancing Your Small Business (Barron's Business Library Series) http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764124897/powerhomebizguid\n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online http://gtionline.fdncenter.org  . It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for "students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices." Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.

I followed the procedures of how to use diane 35 but  now my period still doesn't came?   Hun, are you 35? If you are ...I have a friend in California, I grew up with, who told me, she went through menopause when she was in her 30s.......My sister & I are, both in our 40s, and we both are going through whats known as, "Perimenopause", for those woman who dont quite go a whole 12 months, without a period. See, my sister & I do get our periods, still, we just dont get them every month, like most young ladies do.. We get them about every 5 months, and she went 8 months without getting hers.....Its really nice, because, its suppose to ease the side effects from the actual "Menopause" once we do go through the actual real-deal.. Dont be alarmed. Unless you think your maybe pregnant.. Then that could very well be the reasons for not having your period, yet. I would  just go and buy one of those pregnance home-kits, to see and make sure thats not what it is.. Then you can delete that one, and know it could very well be Perimenopause or even actual Menopause... Dont stress honey, we all go through this, one way or another! Smile, and just be Happy, and let Nature do its thing!

Hey everyone, I need answers/opinions to the following question:(for ppls tht have read the book The Outsiders There are two main groups in The Outsiders, Socs. and Greasers. How were the Socs of more of a disgrace and a menace to society than the Greasers. How did society view and treat each of the two groups? What are the characteristics of each group, their actions, and the choices each made. \n\nIf anyone has any answers to any part of this question, please, please, please let me kno!!! The Socs are like the towns good two shoes but in disquise they are really dirt they do more bad things then the greasers do. Greasers like to fight fair but the Socs always pulls out switch blades. Greasers are much kind and they dont gang up on one person and jump them.[at least not like the Socs] The Greasers are really like normal people. Socs think they are better then anyone in the world they think they can get anything or anyone. Greasers just be themselfs they dont go around jumping people for the fun of it like the Socs. The only reasons they are really bad is to live. They steal because they cant afford those things. Socs steal because its fun even thought they have enought money.
how to get rid of eye bags? its been my problem, eversince that i had a dark circles under eyes, and i want to get rid with it..any natural ways you can site..to help my prob?:-) ok! well i used to have the same problem, MAJORLY! I read heaps about this. One thing i never knew is that eye liner actually contributes to this, because it carries chemicals that go into the pores to give this effect- so try not to wear it often and ALWAYS wash your face really well.\n\nNow theres this stuff... i totally cant remember what its called! Well like its something like moisture boost or something? and its meant for putting under your eyes! it works really well! \n\nbecause the skin under your eyes is half the thickness of the rest of the skin on your face, so it is prone to dryness and bags.\n\nDo a search and read up about it. All skin types are diffferent, and different methods will have different effects.

Does she like me? She has a boyfriend and I told her I had a crush on her. She said "that's so sweet." Than gave me a hug. And the next day she flirted with me a little. She told my friend that she thinks i'm cute, but never said she likes me. So I told her I had a crush but, she never said if she likes me back.\n\nSo what do you think this means? Well, i think she likes you ... because no girl will tell your cute after you told her that you had a crush on her... nor she will say your cute in front of your friends... She likes you but can't say anything because she has a boyfriend... so just give her some time... maybe she will give you some clues that she wants to be with you...
How do I grow taller and is there time left? Hi, I'm an 18 yr old boy and i was wondering if i could still grow taller than I already am and if so, how - any suggestions? You might still grow a little - but not much i'm afraid: Probably an at the most! Boys tend to have a large growth spurt during their middle teen years (14-16). This is when most of your growth would have taken place. This is in contrast to girls who usually start their growth spurt early in their teens (12) but theirs is more slower and gradual. Both males and females stop growing around about the age of 18-21!

Why can't Chicago have a good quarterback??!?!?! Why???Why?!? I mean they've never had a really good quaterback like Carson Palmer, Peyton Manning or McNabb. Why?!?!?!?! Don't the bears' presidents know how to draft a quarterback?!?!?!\n\nWTF?!?! Rex Grossman has been throwing too many picks man it's so sad for the Chicago folks. \n\nI almost weeped for them on sunday. Their Defense is so damn fun to watch but their passing game is straight garbage. And they got some nice receivers man!!!!!!!! Berrian would easily be better than Reggie Wayne if he played for the Colts.\n\nI suggest they trade somebody and go draft Brady Quinn or Troy Smith in the upcoming draft. \n\nyou agree? Hold on a minute.  Rex Grossman has more touchdown passes than he does interceptions.  Granted, he has been playing subpar compared to the beginning of the season, but that's to be expected.  He's in his first year as a starting quarterback.  People are beginning to figure out how to play against him.  Once he learns to read defenses, he will be an excellent quarterback.  He has an amazing accurate arm; he just needs to learn to use it.  Give him time, and he'll be a great quarterback.\n\nAlso, the Bears are 9-2.  I don't see them getting rid of a quarterback that is leading the team with a record like that.  If anything, they should think about replacing Brian Urlacher because he's getting old and won't be nearly as good in 3 or 4 years.
Muslims! If Allah has blessed you with the responsibility of knowledge, do you use it to help humanity? this knowledge is not limited to just college or university degrees.  it could be your trade, your faith, your life's experiences.\n\ndo you contribute constructively to your society with your knowledge?\n\ndo you keep yourself informed of the state of affairs - locally, nationally, internationally and help those around you to understand it?\n\ndo you deliver the message of the faith you practice to those who do not know? yes ( god willing), and there are many hadiths for our beloved prophet (peace be upon him), that encourages us to help ppl , in every thing , or tells us that the best of the ppl are those who learn and teach (in every thing), it is so rewarding.\n\nthank u brother.

Why are conservatives opposed to gun control? I'm a conservative myself, but it bewilders me whenever I see some country-fried lunkhead complaining about government regulation on gun ownership, when it's been proven that gun control decreases gun-related crime.  I mean, assault weapons?  These people think we should be able to own ASSAULT WEAPONS?!  I just don't get it.  Can someone explain? Gun control had never worked.  Please provide a link so that your "proof" can be seen.  Assault weapons have been illegal to own since 1968 (unless you get a special class III license from the B.A.T.F.) so I don't understand your problem there.  You need to read the book by John Lott .  "More Muns, Less Crime".  Also,  the FBI recently did a study that shows that from 1991 to 2005, Americans have bought 70,000,000 guns, yet crime, since '91 has decreased by 38%.  I can't find this study on-line, I read about it in a magazine.  Concealed carry works also.  Florida's 2005 murder rate was 58% lower than in 1986, which was the year before Florida adopted (wisely) Right to Carry laws.  There are already many laws  to keep the wrong people from buying firearms.  The problem is that for some reason, criminals will not obey the law!!  They keep acquiring guns illegally.  So more laws are obviously not the answer.  Laws only affect the law abiding.  And by the way, I am NOT a conservative.  But, I believe that since guns do not kill, people do, then people should take the responsibility and the punishment, not guns.
Whats a good way to raise money to get someone out of jail? I need to get $1500 to get them out?   No, I would assume you mean to make bail, not pay for an escape.  But also remember if they make bail, in most places they can not use a pubic defender, since making bail shows they have or had the money to hire thier own attorney.\n\nWork second job,  sell your computer, TV, sterio.

usa tourist visa? if someone is on a student visa in the scandinavia such as sweden, norway, denmark, is he/she going to have better chances for a USA tourist visa and get it. I personally believe it wont be easier. No matter he/she has the temporary schengen visa, it doesnt mean when he/she applies for the usa tourist visa, he/she gets it. Your assumption is correct:  being legally in a Schengen country will not help your chances of getting a US tourist visa.  In fact, it might be even more difficult because you are expected to apply in your own country, where consular officers with the most knowledge about conditions there can assess your application most fairly.

Decreasing in energy, next is ultraviolet rays. Then comes the range of light that we can see, called accordingly, visible light. With lower energy than that is microwaves and radio waves which have the longest wavelengths and shortest frequencies.
my mother has water behind her lungs what causes that ?   If she has fluid it wouldn't be behind the lungs but in them. Ordinarily the lungs fill with fluid because the heart is flabby and is not pumping correctly so fluid backs up into the lungs and a stated is called CHF, congestive heart failure. Pleurisy on the other hand is an infection in the pleural space, between the layers and is treated with antibiotics. It causes chest type pain. A course of antibiotics will cure this but it does NOT take months to happen.
Why is it that in other countries 11,000 million lawbreakers is considered chaos and here it's called America? The illegals I'm referring to, of course.  Their gross disrepect for our laws, failure to assimilate, and making the rest of us cater to them is contemptable and should be punished. One reason is because America is so large.  Europe is chopped up into countries that are smaller that most U.S. states.  If 11 million illegal aliens entered Switzerland for example that would be overwhelming.  Besides the Swiss are smart enough to not let that happen.\n\nThe illegal aliens that invade this country are criminal, lawbreaking, illegal alien, foreign national invading our country like locust!\n\nAMERICA DO NOT REWARD ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR!

Jewels in a Watch?? I've just bought a Swatch, and on the back it says Patented water-resistant...... four(4) Jewels, I also went on e-bay to look at watches and found some realy old (50's/60's) watches with 17 and 23 jewels in them, I guessing the jewels aren't diamonds or emeralds etc so what are they? and why are they in the watch? Jewels are used as the bearing surfaces for pivot points and gear axles. They are tiny precious stones.\nBecause they are so hard they do not require lubrication when polished.  \nIn mechanical watches there were always an odd number of jewels due to the single jewel in the escapement. Modern crystal oscillator types have no escapement so the low even number of jewels is because of the reduced number of pivots in the watch compared to old gear driven watches where jewels are used in pairs plus one for the escapement.\nMore jewels usually means a higher quality and more accurate watch.
Public breastfeeding? What's your opinion?  What do you think about the woman who refused to cover up while feeding her kid on the plane and then got kicked off?  What about all the clever slogans the protesters came up with?  (Got breast milk? Don't be lactose intolerant, etc.)  Do you think we need to nip(ple) public breastfeeding in the bud? Let me just say that I was raised on a farm and "cows don't care who looks at their nipples".  A lady would cover up.
Can someone give me a website where i can make a DNA model for a school project? I need a instruction sheet on how to make a DNA model with all the matrials. I did the same project once.\nSome people I know actually went to a crafts store like Hobby Lobby, Michael's, etc. and got what is known as a DNA Model kit (something like that). All you have to do then is put it together and it would be smart to decorate of paint it to make it look original.\n\nAs for me I took the stupid and long route. I used pipecleaners for the sides of the helix and straws(anything firm) for the nucleotides. You put pipecleaners thorough the middle of the straws(nucleotides) so you can tie it to the side.

We dont use condoms is this safe? Me and my fiance have been together for 2 years and are living together. We have both had STD tests and have recently stopped using cnodoms (I am on the pill so i wont get pg). Do you think i am safe considering we had the tests? Please advise. If you are in a committed exclusive relationship then yes it's as safe as it can be. No-one can ever guarantee 100% that their partner won't cheat on them but you trust him and that's all you can do. I have been with my partner for 5 years and three years ago we stopped using condoms and I take the pill and have had no probs so far. Good luck

Ideas for a youth centre? I am working with a group of young people goth, emo type crowd and need some ideas about what kind of activities, events... might be good to do with them. I think looking at the strengths of your location might be the best option.  If you live in a city, try outings to parks or museums or other unorthodox habitats.\n\nArt is also an interesting way to promote self exploration and expression.  Have them use any style, abstraction, colours or media.  Maybe even look at how to bring street art into their work to make a link with urban movements.\n\nAnother approach may be photography; as right now everyone has a camera in one form or another.  The camera phone movie challenge is always interesting and again, it promotes a lot of self exploration.\n\nThere are a lot of other activities that can be encouraged, but I dare not bore you.  I hope these suggestion could at least be a catalyst for more ideas.

He actually does research with his team and is not afraid to shake things.  If Arnold can become governor of California the Al should be able to get something.  He could even be president.  Vote for the Frankenator! I'd vote for him!

How does the word diabetes get its name?   I think you meant to say "How did the disease diabetes get its name?" but no matter.  I believe the name diabetes comes from the Greek word diabainen, which means to pass through (that could be like a siphon).  Hipprocrates coined the name because of the diabetic characteristic of excessive excretion of urine.
acetylene gas is produced from calcium carbide and water.If 32 g of calcium carbide are consumed, how many g ? grams of water are needed?\nthank you everybody..... The balanced reaction is:\nCaC2 + 2H2O ---> C2H2 + Ca(OH)2\n\nThe molar mass of CaC2 is 64 g/mol so you are starting with 0.5 moles of calcium carbide.  Since water reactions with CaC2 is a 1:2 ratio, you will need twice as much water, or 1.0 moles of water = 18 grams of water.
Is Saddam Hussein behind all the insurgency in Iraq? It seems that right when Saddam went to prison, the insurgency errupted.  I read online that Saddam and his relatives are funding the insurgency.  If this is true, why don't they just do away (kill) him and his relatives? its not as hard to understand as most dems want to make it.  lets make it simple.  WE ARE NOT FIGHTING IRAQ, WE ARE FIGHTING IN IRAQ.  Its the front line of the war.  these so called insurgents are from all over they have come to Iraq because that is where the fighting is.  They are gonna fight and we have to fight them.  It has to be some where and Iraq is were its is taking place now.\n\nyou believe everything you read?

I need the form The depositor's authorization to transfer funds for support.?   I am assuming that you need to deposit your ex's support payments directly into his/her account.\n\nGo to the bank where the account is held and tell them you have a court order stating you must deposit the funds (you do, don't you?).  They will get the paperwork you need then you and then your ex will have to sign it, probably in a bank officer's presence.\n\nIf you are transfering money from your bank to a completely different bank, you need to go to your bank first and find out how to transfer the funds electronically without incurring any Wire Transfer fees (which can be as high as $50 per transaction).\n\nIt may be easier to just go to the ex's bank and get a bunch of blank deposit slips.  Fill in his/her name address and account number and then either mail them, deposit as normal, or use the night depository.\n\nGood luck, support sucks.

Neither one of us are married, and we haven't dated anyone in the past 5 years, we just have been seeing each other I don't know if we are going together or not I want him to tell me. I told him I think I better quit, but he told me please don't no one knows the business better than me but he means more to me than this job. Is there a serious possibility of running the company together? A valid question...you need to have a straightforward talk about how you both feel. Is this going to turn into something serious?

what are the rules/scoring stuff for baseball? I get really bored watching the game so i want to know what's really going on. You must really understand the game in order to enjoy it, but once you truly understand it, you will probably enjoy it greatly. I would read this website: http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/official_rules/objectives_1.jsp\nThis will give you an in-depth look at the rules and positions. You should really try to discuss the sport with someone who really enjoys and understands it because you will get a lot out of it. Be persistent in your watching of the games and pay attention to the commentary to help learn more. Hope this helps!
Career advice for new college grad? What do you do when you know that you hate your current job, but are unsure of where you want to move next, but you feel as if you stay at your current job (which pays over 60k) a moment longer that you are going to choke the manager, tie him up, and send him to India on a tiny sailboat?\nI am a recent college graduate at my first job...and although I love the company that I am with, I despise my job title...but I am not allowed to change positions before my first year is up...which is 4 more months to go. Does anyone have advice on how to be productive in a seemingly non productive situations? You definitely have the carrot dangling in front of you- unless you live in california, 60k to start is excellent bucks- so whenever you start picturing your hands moving towards your managers neck and call fed ex to send him to india via the slow boat to china route, THINK OF THE GREEN- the moola, the buckos-- and as far as being productive, it seems you've been faking it pretty good so far, so just continue doing the same.  Good luck

Have you ever been "chased down" by the Walmart Greeter because they thought you stole something? The other day I walked out of Walmart and heard a beep but thought nothing of it.But then I have like this 80 yearold midget running after me like I stole something..Has this ever happend to you..and Why do they give the "Greeting" job to like people who look like they are retarded. First of all, the incorrect term is not "midget" nor is it "retard".  And usually when you do hear a beep, an person who did not steal anything would go back and willy have them examine their bag.  It doesn't take a retard to know this.  God, I hate ignorant people who talk that.

What is the brightest star and how far from it would we have to be to get the same light we get from theSun? Also how far away from this brightest of stars would we have to be to experience the same heat levels? Thanks The intrinsically brightest star known is S Doradus, a star in one of the Magellanic Clouds.  It is so far away that it can only be seen with a telescope, and in fact probably no longer exists, since its distance of 180,000 light years exceeds its estimated life expectancy of 160,000 years.  However, you would have needed to be 0.11 lightyear from it to have the same insolation as the Earth gets from the Sun.  Of course, a larger percentage from S Dor would be in the form of ultraviolet, enough to kill in a few hours.  Not recommended for tourist visits by the Galactic Chamber of Commerce.
Examine Odysseus' relationship to the supernatural universe surrounding him. At what moments does he lack? control over his surroundings? At what moments does he seem in command of his own fate and that of his companions? What message may we inter from Homer's treatmen of Odysseus' relationship with the gods? What do we learn about the poet's views on human nature and its interaction with forces beyond its control? Sounds like a homework to me again. Was this asked by your professor?

What is the effect of temperature pespin activity and effect of ph on pespin activity? in regards of using boiled eggs- cutting them into four equal pieces and placing 1 piece in each test tube. 2 pieces are covered with pepsin in dilute acid. One goes into the incubator and the other in the refrigerator. the other two pieces are covered with pepsin in alkali and one piece goes in the incubator and the other in the refrigerator. Disregard those in alkali: they cannot work!\nPepsin is in the stomach thus its optimum pH is acidic. You ar now left with two. The one in the fridge cant work well as enzyme activity is slowed by low temperature. Thus the one that would digest the egg is the one in acid, in the incubator as these conditions are optimum for pepsin's activity.
My wife won't do things with me? I'm not talking sexually, I mean she just won't go to the movies or go grab coffee or anything.  She has no problem driving for hours to go have a night out with her friends doing stuff that she says she doesn't like but barely even tries to find a baby sitter for us and that's only if I bug her about it.  We've only gone and done something once this year and that was because her mom offered to come watch the kids.  I'm not a bad guy and have always been EXTREMELY loving and understanding (when her friends complain about their husbands/boyfriends they say they wish they were more like me) and happy to do things that she wants.  She still acts very loving at home but just won't go out with just us.\nIts gotten to the point to where I don't have any real desire to do things in the bedroom with her at all because I don't know if she's that's bored with me and/or she's so boring she's unattractive to me and I've gotten to the point I just don't even care anymore. Hey, you STOLE my screen name!
What do you do when excersise doesn't work? Ok so I'm 17 and I weigh ...ok I'm a girl and I'm not telling, but a lot and I really need to lose weight. Not only do I need to but I'm a high school senior and winter formal, prom and graduation are right around the corner and I want to look great. But here's the thing, I try to hit the gym at least 4 times a week and I'll do about 45 mins of cardio and I'm slowly getting into the weights and machines like those but my weights not coming down. Not only that but I can't seem to actually stick to any plan I make for myself. Like I said, I'm only 17 so I'm really tight on money and there's no way I can get a personal trainer. I need to lose weight and I need to do it now. I'm hopping for 40 pounds my May. Is that too unrealistic and how can obtain my goal? Sorry, this isn't really any help, but I have the same problem.. I've been doing regular exercise, including weight training and cardio for months, with a personal trainer that I see every two weeks, and I haven't lost an ounce! My trainer says I'm probably losing fat and gaining muscle weight, and the same goes for you I'm sure, but any addiitonal weightloss has to come from a healthy diet and drinking lots of water, according to my trainer! Good luck, I know how hard it is!!!

Homework help using Yahoo! Voice??? Hello, I need someone to connect with me on Yahoo voice to listen to some sound clips and tell me what you hear! It's for my linguistics (phonetics) class. It only takes a minute and I would very much appreciate it. My screen name is Movelikejellyfish...\n\nThe words you are listening for are pie tie kye buy die guy spy sty sky. It seems that you are supposed to do this assignment, if it's your class.  I love phonetics though!\n\nEDIT: An experiment!  I see.  It might be hard to hear over Yahoo! Voice.  I probably don't qualify as a participant because I already know about phonetics.  As we say in my lab, "Do good science!"\n\nAdditional edit: I agree that over the phone is not a good option, since phones take out some high-frequency information that helps us to understand.  Are you not allowed to do your experiment in person?  Please forgive me for doubting you before.  I'd rather not participate myself, but I hope your career in linguistics is smashing!\n\nIf you're really hard up for participants, send me an e-mail in Yahoo! Answers.  I might reconsider.

What is the best, quickest way to get a work permit for United Kingdom? I was living in London working as an actor. My work permit was dependent upon my wife. She was a teacher which was why she was granted the work permit.  In the end she didn't like London and decided to return to the USA. We are now back in the states but seperated. I feel like a fish out of water. I need desperately to go back. I love London. I miss it terribly. It's the theatre capitol of the world and all my friends are there. The problem is I don't have any high demanding skills. As the saying goes: "I am a Jack of many trades, but a master of none." I am a member of British Equity. I am quite desperate. I was thinking of signing up for college courses, say two, for a year and getting a student visa. Does this make sense? I have also thought about running an advertisement for marriage to any UK citizen in exchange for US citizenship. That's how desperate I am.  Any help, any suggestions, any ideas, any websites that offer help will be greatly, GREATLY appreciated! Signing up for a marriage visa is a lot harder than you think and it's commonly viewed as a subversive way to enter the country. I suggest you contact your friends there regarding the actors guild or some such group to see if you can get sponsorship that way.
Is it ok to harass everyone who enters a Planned Parenthood clinic?   Planned Parenthood clinics provide a lot more services than just abortions, don't just assume that because someone is going to a Planned Parenthood clinic they are there for an abortion. They could be going for birth control, pregnancy testing, they also give check ups and pap tests, treat and test STD's. Ignorance can be deadly. Stop the ignorance.

How many times have you been grounded in the last year?  Who is the best actor/actress?\nThink about the general question, "What do you find interesting?"  If a person you are "hitting on" asks you about music, art, politics, or food, then which one will have the most fun answering?  Now pick out an item on the favorite subject where people have different opinions.
question for girls.? what would you do if you knew a guy who would do anything in the world for you, every time you were together he treated you like you were the only person alive and no one else mattered. when you needed him at 2 in the morining he was just a phone call away, when you just needed someone to listen to you and not judge you he was there. when just felt like there was no need to go on and he would convince you other wise. if you just needed a shoulder to cry on and a hug for comfort. when no one else cared he did. he would give up his last dollar just to make sure you had one. he would fight who ever it was even if he knew he would lose just to keep you safe. would walk in the rain without a jacket just so you could have his, sell his last possesion just to make sure you had enough. say he loves you in front of his friends and not care what they think because in the end he knows he has you. what would you do for a guy like this, because they do exisit. and you probably know one. just look!
Helpz? :-) :-(? At the end of the 1992-1993 season, basketball player Michael Jordan had scored 21,541 points in 667 regular season games. He then anounced his retirement. If he had contiued at this rate, in what game would he have broken Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record of 38, 387 points? I'm stupid in math so could u plz explain how u figured this out??? PLEASE! At a rate of 32.3 points a game(which is was he was averaging for his career before first retirement) it would have taken about 522 games or about 6 and 1/3 seasons at 82 games a season to tie and or surpass Abdul-Jabbar in points.

Is it possible to sue a company for pain and suffering due to a work injury? My lawyer is telling me I cant !! I have  apending case, and it doesent seem like my lawyer is doing all that he can to help me!  He says that I cant sue for pain and suffering.  I want to know if thats true! I had surgery and the scars are hidious and Ive gained wieght at least 30 pds since the inccident and my job ened up laying me off!! What should I do? Workers' compensation laws are created entirely by the legislature, so what benefits you are entitled to receive depend on the laws in your state.  Workers' Comp is supposed to be a compromise that allows employers to have some limit on liability in exchange for worker protections in case of work injuries.  For example, if there were no workers' comp laws, an employer could simply avoid liability for work injuries by going out of business and leave the worker holding the bag for medical bills and lost wages.   In exchange for this protection for workers most states do not allow workers to sue the employer, other than for workers' comp benefits, except in very limited circumstances. (like intentional injuries or violations of certain safety requirements)  The law usually does provides for some type of award of compensation for permanent impairment.  In Ohio, it's called a permanent partial disability award.  That gives you some award of compensation to account for permanent residuals of the allowed conditions in your claim.  There are also additional awards if you lose the use of a bodypart, such as an arm, leg or finger.  Unfortunately, there is no specific award for pain and suffering.   Good luck and best wishes for a full recovery.
Why is the enzyme catalase still active in liver cells even when the cells are no longer living?   beacuse catalase is found in peroxisomes and peroxisomes contain their own DNA and so peroxisomes in affect will continue to produce peroxide which needs to be converted to water and oxygen with the help of catalase. if not the cell will begin to excrete peroxide and damage the whole liver.

Just thinking about it...? Do you think that all humans are bisexual (and that society makes them straight or defines right and wrong for them)? I think people are born gay, straight or bi. Beyond that, people are turned on or off by certain things, but there is no pressure created that is proven to "turn" people against their own orientations.
What exactly did the Federal Elections Campaign Act do? I am trying to write a paper about campaigns and elections and I am not really sure what this Act did. Please explain it to me in a way I will understand. Thank you. The FEC...it limits fundraising by PACs (Political Action Committees) for political parties or candidates during elections. It limits hard money, which are donations given directly to a candidate to support their campaign. And it limits soft money, which are donations given to a political party to support their campaign.

Ebay problem with a seller-advice please? I bought tickets for a stage show from ebay on Tuesday night. The seller had listed in her description that the tickets had not yet been delivered to her, but she had a confirmation that they're on their way and would send this to the winning bidder. I haven't received the confirmation so I haven't yet paid. By this morning I'd already had two rude messages from her sent through ebay, saying that she has sent the confirmation to me already, she wont send it again, and that she will relist the item as she cannot afford to wait for me! \nI've been using ebay for years and I always thought the buyer was allowed three days to pay?\nThis seller has very low feedback, although they're all positive and all for tickets. \nAm I right to be wary of her? Or should I pay without seeing the confirmation? Any advice would be appreciated, thank you. I would wait.  Notify ebay of what is going on so that they too are informed.  And it is rude of the seller to be hounding you.  It sounds to me as if the Seller might need your money to pay for the tickets themselves.

Do you know  the types of cases that the House of Lords hears? Can you list them by their names? HELP ME PLZ!! welcome people who are resident in England and know about english law :) and everybody who knows!! The British House of Lords currently serves as the Court of Last Resort for many (but not all) appeals in the United Kingdom.  It hears most cases on appeal, but the process is bit more complicated than it is for most national supreme courts.\n\nIf you consult the following article, you should gain a pretty good understanding of the types of cases the body hears (and doesn't hear).  Please note that under recent constitutional reforms, the judicial functions of the House of Lords will soon pass to a separate national supreme court.
What is an "otis bulb"? Pertaining to genitourinary surgery. The inventor, Otis Charles White, was a practicing Dentist in Massachusetts during the days when gas lamps were the top lighting technology. At that time, because there was no source for quality adjustable lamps, Otis White invented and built the first "gas" lamp fixture designed specifically for his own use in Dentistry. In the 1880's, Edison incandescent electric lamps began to quickly replace gas lighting. A true visionary in his own field, Doctor White set out to redesign his medical specialty gas lamp fixture by adapting electric components to his fixture. Doctor White understood that Dentistry and other procedures required a special light source that could be easily, quickly, and reliably directed and locked upon the important area of need. Doctor White was familiar with this special requirement because of his early experiments with his first gas Dentist's lamp. He put his skill and attention to detail, and the popularity of his new electric "Dentist's" light became the talk of the industry. Colleagues began to request it. To keep up with this new growing demand, Doctor White founded the O.C. White Company in 1894. Immediately O.C. White Company became famous, known worldwide as the maker of the finest professional adjustable specialty lighting fixtures in the 1890's.\n\nFeatures and details: this specialty lamp fixture has a superbly detailed cast iron Victorian base that is approximately eight inches square and three inches high. The base is accented with a beautifully proportioned round two inch cast brass transition ring made in a classic embossed floral design. The smooth brass stem is 1.5" diameter and 7" tall up to the second transition. The stem vertical extension is a 10" x 5/8" diameter "barber pole" brass rope. At the top of the barber pole stem is a brass ball. The adjustable "boom" arm has the O. C. White solid cast iron adjustor equipped with their trademark heavy 1.5" diameter iron knob (cast with eight individual 3/8" balls equally spaced around the circumference). The adjuster allows the boom arm to be set at a desired angle and moved up and down the vertical stem to change height. The end of the boom arm has a second adjuster made of solid cast iron used to angle the lamp socket. The socket base is furnished with a secondary brass arm that supports the brass lamp hood. The hood shrouds the Edison lamp socket and light bulb. The solid brass hood has a craftsman hammered embossed festoon filigree accent and is attached via a scalloped self tensioned adjustment hinge that allows the illuminating light to be fine tuned and directed as needed. This extraordinary lamp fixture stands 24" tall is 24" long and 8" wide.

Do you think Australia can beat the Blacks on the Rugby Union World Cup ?   Interesting question, there are a few things to consider.\n\n1. Australia seem to be testing players in certain positions.  In the spring/autumn test series they have shown players cannot play in certain positions.\n\n2. New Zealand seem to fall short of their postential in World Cups.  They won the first RWC, but have failed to win any others.  Some will say they were poisoned in South Africa in 1999, but there is no evidence of this.\n\n3. What stage of the tournament Australia meets New Zealand (Al Blacks).  If it is in a semi final, NZ may have peaked too early, and are starting to fade.\n\nFor Australia to beat New Zealand the three things above need to happen.\n1. Australia finds depth for their squad, especially in key areas.\n2 & 3. New Zealand peaks too early and the team is starting to fade for the semi finals.

Poly is for reainwater guttening explain the reasons? Why guttening made from iron why polythene a better? Poly there is used for reainwater guttening. Explain the reasons for it's use? Some olther guttening may be made from iron explain why polythene would be a better choice? The 'poly' you are referring to is polyvinyl chloride. It has a number of advantages over iron.\n1. Iron corrodes (rusts) and requires painting every few years to protect it.\n2.  Iron is heavy and so heavier stronger brackets and support is needed and will be physically more difficult to put up.\n3.  Polyvinyl chlride is much easier to cut to any required length.\n3.  Polyvinyl chloride is cheaper than cast iron

If you feel like the fifth wheel in this group, maybe it's time to find some new friends to hang with. I'm not saying to leave your old friends, but just to expand the number of people to hang with.

Do we (USA) have neuclear bombs? And if so, WHY?  Why is it that we are allowed to have all these sophisticated bombs and military equip. but we don't want any other country to have them. \nWhy is it we can have bombs but not North Korea or Iran? \nShouldn't they have the right to be able to protect their selves like we have? \nJust wondering.. The US has a large arsonal of nuclear weapons. The nastiest is the one most tempting to use, that is Neutron bombs which only poison the land it's dropped on for hundreds not thousands of years. \n\nNuclear weapons are scary in that whole cities go poof. Then a cloud of radiation spreads poison accross the world. Huge clouds of dust are kicked up which if enough nukes are discharged can bring on what's called nuclear winter. That is a literal ice age. So in short we never want to see nukes used on Earth every again if we can help it. At one point the US and USSR created enough nuclear weapons that we could split the crust of the earth completely ending life on Earth. The radiation released if most of those weapons were discharged would keep the Earth glowing in the dark for thousands of years. Both the US and USSR have destroyed many of those nukes but not all. \n\nIf nukes are that bad why does anybody keep them? \n\nThere are several reasons. The first being to prevent others who are more likely to use them from getting and using nuclear weapons.  Isreal for example if it were nuked would deffinitely respond. It's retaliation would obliterate the Arab world to the point that Arab culture would cease to exist and the rest of the world would be poisoned by the nuclear exchange between the Arabs and Isrealis. \n\nWhich leads me exactly to why we don't want Arab nations gaining nuclear power. The Isrealis are not going to nuke Iran just because they don't like the way the Iranians part thier teeth in the morning. Isreal has a stable goverment and it's people would not accept a leader who'd use a first strike tactic. England, Germany, France and most other members of the nuclear club are the same way.  Instead of desert storm we could have nuked Iraq. We in the US wouldn't even seriously consider it. Iran would not hesitate to use nuclear weapons. Saddam used chemical weapons. This is typical of most Arab nations. \n\nIn general every nation that has nuclear weapons is a nation that can start a war that will erase mankind from the face of the earth. So the fewer the better. Despotic governments CAN NOT be tolerated to own nuclear weapons. They are far too likely to use them. In the case of both North Korea and Iran the nations are led by sanity challenged people who have have little santicty for life.  These are exactly the kind of people who will use nuclear weapons. At the least millions will die, possibly every person on the planet if nukes are used. A non-nuclear nation will find it very difficult to prompt a nuclear response. \n\nOther reasons we keep nukes include the fact we may need to use them to split an astroid on a collision course with the earth, they are the strongest weapon we have, so it might be the only thing we can attack  a hostile alien force with. We keep them as a guarentee to our existance.  China for example has nukes. Were the US to not have them China could nuke key US cities and invade us. Our possession of nukes is a deterrent to such actions.  So nukes are here to stay until an even more destructive weapon is harnessed. \n\nAs for places like North Korea and Iran, they are not interested in protecting themselves. Were we to invade one of those nations we'd take out the nukes before they could use them. Iran and North Korea have only one reason to want nukes. That is as a first strike weapon. Niether have the air force to defend thier nukes. Niether nation has the affluence to afford the budget to develop them without harming thier own people. North Korea for example has literally allowed it's own people to starve in the streets so they could fund thier nuclear weapons program. So for North Korea and Iran having nukes is like bringing a knife to a machine gun fight. They might get lucky but really it's very slim chance they could use thier weapons defensively against a current nuclear power. It is possible they could use thier weapons against a non-nuclear p

need you opinion?Gay people may cause bad influence to cloning? I need you opinion?Gay people may cause bad influence to cloning?They may force forward cloning process?they migth ask to have their own babies and that will destroy socity norms? No.\nActually "we" have the exact same options that anyone else has when dealing with not being fertile with our "partner" and have no more influence toward cloning of the sort that you suggest than other groups.\nSo far surrogacy, artificial insemination, and adoption seems to work pretty well. I don't see that changing.\nCloning a human being in the method you suggest still hasn't happened and as far as I know is still years away.\n\nAll I can "see" from your question is just another sad attempt at finding another reason to disparage gays.

Ever used the medication Drysol? It's a type of antipersperant that you apply only at night. Is it true that you aren't supposed to use your normal deoderant after you wash the Drysol off in the morning? Drysol (aluminum chloride) tends to leave the areas to which it is applied very dry.  Using deodorant in conjunction with it can exacerbate this dryness and lead to irritation.

Any Corrections officers here? I'm thinking of becoming a corrections officer need to what the job is like.   I worked as a corrections officer in a juvenile facility for 2 yrs.  Pretty much the same as a lower level prison for adults.  \n\nI found that I felt a bit claustrophobic, as I had to go through 4 locked gates to get out.  Plus, you always have to be watching your back (some of those "kids" were bigger than me and crazy as a loon) because you never know what/who is coming up behind you.\n\nYou have to be really detailed oriented in every aspect of the job (keeping logs, recording property, paper work) and at times it can be rather boring, like at night when every one is locked up and you just patrol the halls.\n\nIt can be fun when you get drunk/high bookies and the newbies are always in shock when you have them strip, do the searches and issue them someone elses underwear.\n\nBottom line is...You'll either love it or hate it, but there is rarely a dull moment and it is decent pay and generally good benefits.\n\nGood luck to you.

Who sings the song 'The Gift' other than Garth Brooks? This is the first verse,\n\n"A poor orphan girl named Maria \nWas walking to market one day \nShe stopped for to rest by the roadside \nWhere a bird with a broken wing lay \nA few moments passed till she saw it \nFor it's feathers were covered with sand \nBut soon clean and wrapped it was traveling \nIn the warmth of Maria's small hand"\n\nThis is played often on radio stations during the holidays and I don't know the name of the artist.

Why do i have dreams about me cheating on myboyfriend? i really love him and i know i would never do that. Dreams are a form of subconscious stress relief.  You are either worried that he could some day cheat or leave you, or as much as you feel that you wouldn't cheat on him, you have a hidden wild side that hasn't been explored.  You might need to get that out of your system before you can become truly satisfied in a committed relationship.  Make sense?
child birth? what is it like? how do u start preparing? what exactly happens?\nthe person with the best detail but informative is gauranteed 5 stars! : ) The birth starts with the onset of labour, which is usually marked by the beginning of regular uterine contractions. These are felt as tightenings either in the back or across the top of the womb. Sometimes the baby's waters break before the beginning of the contractions or, more commonly, once labour is under way. \nA mucous show is often passed through the vagina at the beginning of labour, which may have streaks of blood in it. Some women pass the show days before going into labour, other women do not pass a show at all, so it is not a reliable sign of labour. \n\nDuring a natural birth, the muscles in the uterus (womb) contract and it's this contraction that's felt as labour pains. Labour is a painful experience, but breathing techniques learned in antenatal classes can make early labour less stressful. \n\nThe contractions cause the baby's head to be pressed down through the pelvis and against the inside of the cervix. This causes the cervix to stretch open (dilate) allowing the baby's head to pass through (descend) into the vagina and onwards into the outside world. \n\nThe birth begins when labour contractions start becoming frequent, intense and of sufficient duration to cause the cervix to open. At the beginning of labour, you will usually be examined externally (abdominal examination), to see how the baby is lying and to be certain that the baby is coming head first. \n\nWhen labour starts, the cervix gets shorter (a process called effacement) and opens (dilates). The cervix is fully dilated when it has opened 10cm. During labour, it's important you don't start pushing before you are fully dilated, because there will be a danger of tearing the cervix. \nOnce your cervix has fully dilated, the first stage of labour is completed and the second stage is about to begin. The first stage generally lasts up to 12 hours in a first labour and seven hours in subsequent deliveries, but each labour is different. \nThe second stage starts when your cervix is completely open (10cm). Usually, there is a sensation of fullness in your vagina or bowel and you wish to push. \n\nMost women will find that the labour pains in the second stage of labour are more bearable, because you can now actively help yourself by pushing. \n\nThe second stage of labour ends with the delivery of the baby. It usually lasts for 45 minutes to two hours in a first labour and 15 to 45 minutes in subsequent deliveries. \nDuring this stage the afterbirth (placenta) is delivered. The placenta is usually delivered within 5 to 15 minutes after the birth of the baby. \n\nThe last stage of birth is a co-operation between yourself and the midwife, although little effort is required to deliver the placenta.\n\nAfter your baby's born, it's routine that you will be given an injection to stimulate the uterus to contract, which helps delivery of the placenta. \n\nMaking the uterus contract in this way reduces the risk of heavy bleeding during delivery of the placenta (post-partum haemorrhage).

Transposition? Music 101 What do you want to know about it?\n\nTransposition is the interval that notes have to be moved up or down for certain instruments to be able to play in concert with a piano or other non-transposing instrument.\n\nFor instance, the soprano clarinet and the trumpet are B-flat pitched instruments (because of the way they are built). In order for them to play the same note middle-C as the piano, you must write (or play) the note 1 step higher on their part ( in this case the D just under the treble clef).\n\nPlease elaborate on your question if you need more. I'll check back.
please help with physics!!? The displacement vector for a 15.0 second interval of a jet airplane's flight is (2450, −2430) m. (a) What is the magnitude of the average velocity? (b) At what angle, measured from the positive x axis, did the airplane fly during this time interval? This is easy.  The displacement is sqrt(2450^2 + 2430^2) = 10 sqrt(245^2 + 243^2) = 3451 m, so the average velocity is 230 m/s.  (You had to divide by 15.)\n\nFor the angle, tan x = -243/245 = -0.99184\n\nThe angle is -44 degrees, 46 minutes

Do you think I'll be accepted to any college with a score of 840 on SATs other than community? I have a 3.2 GPA ,alot of community service, and played some sports. Would any of that matter with a sucky score like that? You can try, there might be a few smaller colleges out there or state schools. If not, go to the 2 year college, ace all of your classes and then transfer out. Even if you don't get a's in all your classes but do well, there will definitly be a school that will accept you. If you trransfer, no one is going to care about your SAT ever again. And you can always try taking them over again. Rolling admissions can go until March and you can probably talk to your guidance counselor about informing the colleges you have applied to or are going to apply to that you will be taking the test again. I believe the college board is offering another test in December, so you can sign up for that one jst go to their website. If you want to know what colleges you might have a shot at, go to the princetonreview.com they have this neat little thing where you enter in all your stats and then the name of a college and it tells you what kind of chance you have at getting in.
If women ruled the world..? Men would sit around and wonder what WE are thinking.\nWomen with cold hands would give men prostate exams.\nPMS would be a legitimate defense in court.\nMen would get reputations for sleeping around.\nSingles bars would have metal detectors to weed out men hiding wedding rings in their pockets.\nA man would no longer be considered a "good catch" simply because he is breathing.\nFewer women would be dieting because their ideal weight standard would increase by 40 pounds.\nShopping would be considered an aerobic activity.\n"Ms." Magazine would have an annual swimsuit issue featuring scantily clad male models.\nMen would not be allowed to eat gas-producing foods within two hours of bedtime.\nMen would be secretaries for female bosses, working twice as hard for none of the credit.\nLittle girls would read "Snow White and the Seven Hunks."\nMen would bring drinks, chips and dip to women watching soap operas.\nMen would HAVE to get Playboy for the articles, because there would be no pictures.\nMen would learn phrases like: "I'm sorry," " I love you," "You're beautiful," "Of course you don't look fat in that outfit." WAIT WAIT WAIT - don't forget the most important one of all:\n\n\n\nThere would be a holiday weekend once a month where the men would have a lottery to see which one of them gets to try and run away from his woman when she's on her cycle, and see if he gets free - if he wins, he gets to have a week's vacation on her next monthly, but if he loses, she would get to use him like a house slave for that week - a man's nightmare made real!!\n\n(looks around to make sure the wife isn't looking......)
Should financial damages be awarded at libel trials? If someone sues someone for libel and wins, do they really deserve finanical damages too? Of course they do.  That's the point to make the person who did harm pay for the harm they did.\nIt is also to discourage others from doing the same nasty stuff.\nUsually you have to prove you had 'real' losses in order to prevail so that means you have lost money in some way and have damages.\nYES they should have to pay all your damages and treble if that is an option.
What does US think UK should do about the upsurge in gun crime ,even though guns are banned in UK.? Most of the gun crime is black on black,but we had a policewoman shot and killed not long ago and yesterday another policeman was shot and seriously wounded.In my opinion the govt. don't seem to do alot while they think it stays in the black community but as soon as it spills over into white suburbia the shit hits the fan. Is this the same in USA? thats why there's a upsurge because they are banned

"pv=nrt" is a subject of chemistry or physics?   That is the "ideal gas law," which is something that you would normally see in a chemistry class. \n\nIn reality, it has applications in both fields. The fields are definitely related in important ways. Long ago, chemistry and physics were very different fields; however, as more was learned about how chemical and physical changes were related, the two fields became related.\n\nSo now there are lots of things that blur the line. However, a fundamental like the ideal gas law will probably FIRST be covered in a chemistry context.\n\nSo if you need to make a classification, then go for "chemistry." Generally "laws" that govern large systems are typically found in chemistry. Of course, all chemistry can be derived from fundamental physical laws. However, doing chemistry purely at a physical level would be difficult. Chemistry uses special structures and relationships to encapsulate lots and lots of physics into simplifications that can be used to do useful chemistry. The ideal gas law is one such example.

biesexuals? my friend is really thinking about turning bi and i think she is she just is afraid to say it...she has said she thought 3 girls were very cute in my school but she would not tell me the third one....if its me i will not kno what to do i mean i would say no if she were to ask me out...but im not that harsh....i dont kno wut to do HELP Okay, here's the long answer:\n\nFirst, I think people's gender attraction falls somewhere along a scale, with the two extreme ends being people who cannot perform at all with someone of the same gender, or on the other end, the opposite gender. I think most people fall somewhere between the two... but often, how people *act* on their mingled attractions is very different than them just *having* said attractions.\n\nAlso, it *can* take a long time for someone who is bi to admit it to themselves, because it's not socially accepted much at this point. It's even harder for male bis than females, in this.\n\nYour friend may be bi, or she may be lesbian. Point is, does it matter? It's a friend, right? So be friends. And as for your worry that YOU are the 3rd person... well, why not try the novel approach of being straight up and honest with her? :D Look her in the eye and say something like "Hey, I've been getting the feeling that maybe you're attracted to girls as well as guys, and since you won't tell me who the 3rd girl is, I suspect it might be me. So, I'm just gonna put this on the table: you're my friend, and you'll always be my friend---but for me, I can't be anything more than just a friend... I'm just not attracted to other girls. But if you are, that's fine."\n\nIf she's a real friend, she'll respect your honesty---especially if you say all that in a friendly, caring, confident way, rather than acting all nervous.\n\nJust be yourself, be honest and caring, and see what happens. It's the best that any of us can do.\n\n(And yes, I'm bi, tho' most of my attraction is for males; and it took me a lot of years to get past cultural conditioning to admit that there were a few women out there I was physically attracted to enough to wish to do something with them.) :)

Did the US goverment created their own pearl harbor attack on911? just to have an excusse to go to war? I have researched this for many an hour over the last 2 months and I am deeply disturbed by my findings.  \n\nFor the most comprehensive answer watch "9/11 Mysteries":\nhttp://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-6708190071483512003&q=9%2F11+mysteries\nIt was started by 4 wodows from the WTC - they wanted to know exactly how and why their husbands died.\n\nIt will start a chain reaction.  I am 31 and I have never seen such shocking news!  I have checked and tripple checked the details on offical sites, news sites and other respected resources.\n\nYou can make your own conclusions about who created 9/11, who allowed it to happen, who knew about it in advance, who financed it and MOST IMPORTANTLY - look at who benifited and how it changed the world.\n\nSince 9/11 the American constitution has been taken from you.  If Bush doesn't like you he can arrange for you to be locked up indefinately, without proof of a crime, he doesn't even need to accuse you of a specific crime.  \n\nI am very glad to hear anyone ask this question.  Please keep asking more and tell your friends your findings.  Most of the mass media (TV and newspapers) are owned by 5 very powerful corperations - they control what you see.  The internet is our lifeline - use it while you can.\n\npeace.

western blotting for JNK and P Jnk using Hela/PA-1 cells protocol?   I have used cell signaling technologies antibodies for JNK, and if you check their website, they have a nice protocol that works in many cell types.  I typically run 10% SDS-PAGE gels for JNK, and be sure to include PMSF, protease inhibitors and NaOVO3 in your lysis buffer-- and keep your lysates on ice at all times.
Can we fight in two different places in the 'war on drugs'? If cartel 'A' is bringing in drugs, does that mean we can only go after them, and not go after cartel 'B' who is also doing bad things?\n\nOr are we allowed to, like we are fighting in Afghanastan AND Iraq? Haven't proven that we can, have we?
Why is sacred femininity so threatening to so many? Powerful religious women seem to be a threat to the male-oriented religions.  Why is this?  Even in the "DaVinci Code," a work of pure fiction, one of the things that upset people was the idea that the Holy Grail was Mary Magdalene's womb.  Why is the sacred feminine so scary to so many?  Not just men--women seem to have just as much of an aversion to it. Most religious systems are controlled by men. So that is their reason for not liking this, power and control is threatened. The other women who voice the same thing have identified with their 'oppressor', the men, and parrot the same attitudes.\n\nWatch me get some thumbs down for this one.
Has Premiership ever been a draw? Has either the Premiership or the First Division (it's previous incarnation) been a draw at the end of the season and had to be settled by goal difference? And what would happen if it was a draw and the GD was the same between the two top teams? the most famous one happened during the 1988-1989 English First Division season. both Arsenal & Liverpool level on points at the end of the season with 76 points but Arsenal win the league due to higher goals scored. both teams has the same goal differences of 37 goals.\n\nironically, the league championship was decided on the last day of the season when Arsenal beat Liverpool at Anfield. Michael Thomas scored the second goal to secure a 2-0 win to seal the championship.

are there any adverse effects on human body if one breathes pure oxygen for long duration? are there any adverse effects on human body if one breathes pure oxygen(say 98%)? If there are any adverse effects, what is themaximum time one can breathe such oxygen  without such adverse effects? At normal pressure yes; oxygen is a very aggressive gas and will quickly cause lung damage. The wikipedia page claims that a few hours is not so dangerous.\n\nAt low pressure (airplane or space shuttle) it is not dangerous if the partial oxygen pressure is around 0.2 bar like on earth.

what is time sharing software? what is multi-access software? what is real time software? for computer science study purposes. Professional law firms, for example, use real time billing software to enter time spent on a phone call, say, and that information will generate an invoice at the end of the month.   Time sharing software lets a whole bunch of attorneys feed their time into the computer, and the software bills the client.

New music suggestions? My most recent favorites are:\n \n *The Chemical Brothers - Galvanize feat. Q-Tip\n\n *Faithless - Insomnia\n\n *Paul Van Dyke - For An Angel\n\n  Clubby with hard beats and a trance movement. \n\n Gimme what you got. Nothing too dark or gloomy, and no cheesy 'castles in the sky' crud. Trance/electronic that puts me in a serious mood to party. I like Paul Oakenfold too if that helps. Thanks in advance.\n\n P.S. To the guy one time who told me Prodigy's Firestarter...um No. That is NOT what I'm looking for. And music within the last year or two is most preferable. That's how long it's been since I've hit the clubs. The Beatles. Ray Charles. Nina Simone. Tupac. Jay-Z. Young Jeezy. The Rolling Stones. Prince. Nas. Outkast. Cee-lo Green. Erica Badu. Kanye ta The.

You gotta stop and ask yourself if the person saying these things and what they say worth getting upset over.....try asking them how they meant what they said.(being able to stand up adn take up for yourself is the first step.) and good luck.you can do it......

When Does Your Man Say I love you? Hi, i need some advice, ok me and my boyfriend have been together for four months now. Well two months ago we had went out and when we were back in the car there were fireworks going off and everything. I grabbed his hand and said "you know i love you dont you"? He said, "yes i do", and he said to me "You want me to say it back don't you'? and i said yes and he said give it time, dont push me, i have been burned twice and i said to him " I would never burn you and i also wouldn't say i love you unless i meant it. He said he know's that? He still hasn't said yet, but we have a lifelong contract together that is more equivalent than the traditional marriage and it states that on the contract and he is going to sign it when i see Him and he says he is soo eager to sign it. i am his slave and Mistress and He is my Master and slave as well. Am i just being patient and unreasonable, or does he love me and is waiting for the right time? Any answers or advice i will gladly appreciate thanks. I was with my man for almost a year before he told me he loved me. I tild him like 3 months into the relationship and yes I did want him to say it back, but I didn't push him. I still told him everyday that I love him but I didn't push him to say it back. Just give him time I am sure he will figure it out that you aren't going to burn him and he will decide when it is right for him to say it back.

Why does nobody talk about this? Why do Muslims knocking Israel hide these facts, or don't they even know them So many talk about Arab Palestinians expelled from Israel that we forget the ONE MILLION Jews expelled from Arab countries they had inhabited for more than two thousand years! Israel's home to one million Arab Muslims (up from just 155,000 sixty years ago)who are excused from certain taxes, don't have to join the army like other Israelis, and have their own Arabic schools and universities. Arabic is also one of Israel's official languages. All over the Arab world there are fewer than 7,000 Jews. The Jewish population of Arab countries has decreased by more than 99%. Unlike Arab countries that don't take care of Arab Palestinian refugees, the State of Israel always supported Arab Jewish refugees. Nothing's changed since these days. Arab media still spits out anti-Semitic propoganda and Muslims hate Jews more than I thought anybody could hate anyone else. Israel treats Muslims very much better than Muslims treat Israelis or Jews. I like what you said.\n\nMay God richly bless you and yours,\n\nAdyghe C.
I need some more help ladies........... fellas? I walked out into my hallway at school a few dayus ago and past a big group of guys with my friend.  I left my friend so that she could talk with her boyfriend and turned the corner, then she came running down the hallway and said that this guy wanted to know if i had a boyfriend i said no only after asking her who he was.  She told him and wanted to meet me after class, i couldn't though cause i had to get to class early to finsh a test.  \n\n         The next day he asked about me, and she told him i was in already in class, and he came looking for me.  Then the same day he came into the llibrary and sat ata table adjacent to me for what i don't know.  Now my friend told him i was intrested and instead of talking to me he acts like he doesn't know who i am because when she told him that, he said who is that.  But he still stares at me when he sees me.  what is that please let me know cause i am dumbfounded he likes you, but is a little shy. he's probably used to being the one who "hunts" down the girl and then workd s up the nerve to ask them out and is not used to being told yea i like you. why don't you walk up to him one day and strick a conversation, if things start going then hey you never know if not then it's not the end of the world. but he definately likes you if he still is staring at you. he's now playing hard to get. make the first advance some guys really like that.

Physics...Need Your Help Please!? An 19.8 g rifle bullet traveling 249 m/s buries itself in a 3.50 kg pendulum hanging on a 2.78 m long string, which makes the pendulum swing upward in an arc. Determine the horizontal component of the pendulum's displacement.\n\nPlease help me solve this! Use conservation of momentum to find the momentum of the pendulum after impact.  From the momentum you can find the energy of the pendulum (be sure to account for the change in mass!).  That kinetic energy become potential energy as the pendulum swings upward.  Use trigonometry to find the horizontal displacement from the vertical displacement.
Where is the bloody thing (I speak of quote by Charles Darwin)? To be honest this is the last place that I expected to be looking for an obscure quote that not many people would know the location of, but I won't doubt the ability of anyone who cares the opportunity to surprise me.  Anyway this quote I'm looking for is something that may be prove that Charles Darwin was in fact the most racially tolerant man in his time.  I can't remember much of the context but I know that it included him saying something like "they don't have nearly enough of a mental difference for me to consider them members of a different race."  I don't have the patience to scan every one of his writings and all the quotes that I'm more than sure that people have placed by the thousands in every bloody place that they can.  So if any of you can help me by quoting it exact, or at least by linking me to a site that is likely to have it, I would much appreciate it. Here's all the writings of Darwin, in which you could do a search:\n\nhttp://darwin-online.org.uk/

is wondering and needs your opinions? a man who cheats on his wife of 24 yrs.....shows no remorse nor guilt....at what point does he realise that he has lost her i mean truely lost her........and does it even matter to him  he knows i loved him with my whole heart and that in cheating he broke mine.......he knows me so well after all the years we had together so he knows how i am.......its hard to realise that he doesnt love me anymore but does he realise that i dont love him and does he even care anymore? A couple of things stood out in your question.....you said , "does he realize that I don't love him anymore?" You do still love him! You're hurt, and angry for the way he treated you, but you still love him anyway....just not his actions toward you. Second, you said" at what point does he realize he has lost her?" Do you think he cares? If he cared , he would not have left you in the first place and broke your heart! It does not matter to him. He is only thinking of himself....not you. I'm not being mean, I actually hurt for you...but stop worrying about what he thinks, and start looking out for yourself. You need to move on, and heal. Good Luck!!

How do you differentiate 2^x? Thanks!? I'm thinking its ln2 but not sure... y = 2^x\n\nln y = ln 2^x\n\nd/dx ln y = d/dx ln 2^x\n\nd/dx ln y = d/dx x*ln 2\n\nPull the constant (ln 2) out:\n\ny'/y = ln 2 * d/dx x\n\ny'/y = ln 2\n\ny' = y * ln 2\n\ny' = 2^x * ln 2\n\n*** Remember this advice, kids.  Whenever you want to get rid of a variable exponent during differentiation, use logarithmic differentiation.  Using it will make things cleaner and easier.
compare and contrast photosynthesis and respiration?   aight here goes \nin a nutshell, the comparison is that they both produce chemical energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the difference is that in cellular respiration glucose and oxygen are used up and carbon dioxide and water are produced, and in photosynthesis, light and water and carbon dioxide are used and oxygen and glucose are produced.\n\na little more in depth, heres the description of both\ncellular respiration - occurs in the mitochondria, first a glucose molecule goes through glycolysis, which produced 2 molecules of ATP and 2 molecules of pyruvate or pyruvic acid - each one of those either enters the crebs cycle and the electron transport chain, or if there isnt enough oxygen it goes into lactic acid cycle - which doesnt produce much energy and produced lactic acid (runners get this and the lactic acid causes muscle soreness), but anyway if there is enough oxygen, the pyruvate goes into the krebs cycle, in it a bunch of things happen to the pyruvate to turn it into different things, ending up in citric acid (krebs cycle is also called citric acid cycle), the krebs cycle produced some more ATPs and other molecules called NADPH and FADPH, after that it enters the stage that produces the most energy the electron transport chain - in this an electron is transported through a bunch of proteins called cytochromes and during this transport protons (H+ ions) are produced, they create a ph gradient between the sides separated by the cristae (inner wall of the mitochondria), and these ions travel through proteins that they call ATP synthease, while doing that they cause ATP to be made from ADP and inorganic phosphate. the electron transport chain produces 28 ATP molecules, giving the whole cycle a total of 32 ATP from one glucose molecule.\n\nPhotosynthesis - occurs in the chloroplast, first light hits an electron in photosystem II, that excites the electron and it goes through an electron transport chain to reach photosystem I, during which it produces energy same way that the etc in respiration does, after that the electron gets hit by light again this time in photosystem I, it gets excited again ang goes through another etc, producing some more ATP as well as NADPH.  these molecules are then used in the Calvin cycle, in which carbon dioxide is absorbed by the plant from the air and used to form 3 carbon sugars which are then combined to form glucose, oxygen is released as a byproduct of that.\n\n\nHope that helps

Why is he mad at me? My Ex bf dumped me last month.  We told each other that we loved each other and wanted to spend the rest of our lives together.  We didn't fight, we got along great.  We had amazing chemistry and loved to talk about anything.  We had a lot in common, ect... then his ex gf asked him to come back to her.  They dated off and on for a year and a half.  So, he chickened out on me and ran back to her.  I was devestated and can not understand how he would give up what we had.  He claims that she is the love of his life.  BUT.... I know this isn't true.  I know that he told other people how he felt about her when they last dated, and he told me the same thing.  He said she was "comfortable" and he could marry her, "why not".  With me, he said he loved me like no other, but that he was afraid that love was just blind.... What the heck?  Anyhow, I was having a hard time and thought that I should remind him how I felt and that I wanted him to come back. In the beginning, I texted him and emailed him a lot.  Then a couple weeks later, he got mad at me.. I asked him if he was mad at me because we were going to try to be friends. He said, "Yes, I asked you to leave me alone.  Please leave me alone".  I was reallyl shocked because he never asked me to leave him alone.  So, I went to his house, after not seeing him for two weeks.  I talked to him.  He admitted that he loved me still, but he made his choice.  He claimed it wasn't easy since he loved everything about me, but he had a "history" with her.  So, we talked, I kissed him on the cheek and I told him I would wait, then left.  He nodded with his eyes swollen and full of tears.  I thought that was a good sign.  So, two weeks after that, I find out they are gonna get married next month.  I was like, wow, he really should not do that.  I sent him an annonomous text message saying , "You don't marry the one you can live with, you marry the one you can't live without". I think it's a big mistake to marry her just so he won't be alone.  So, he texted me back saying I was a harrassing, psychotic stalker!  Wow, I was shocked again. I mean, I have left him alone like he asked for two weeks.  I didn't think sending a text message constitutes a stalker. So, I know he is reallyl angry at me.   I just don't know why?  Is it because he knows it's true and he doesn't want to be reminded, or does he really all of a sudden hate me and want me completely out of his life, when we had said we would be friends down the line. I think that he is torn between 2 different women and he had to decide to choose--- unfortunately he did not choose you.  The other women is probably controlling and has talked him into getting married.  I would say he does not want to talk to you any more b/c of the simple fact that he is ashamed, doesn't want to hurt you anymore and because he probably b/c he also doesn't want to hurt this other girl.  Just give it sometime and see what pans out more than likely if there wedding is a ways off she will probably leave him like she did before... at that point in time if he truly loved you he will come back to you b/c he will have realized what he lost.  I would say even though he is saying hurtful and mean things more than likely he isn't mad at you and is only doing what he is doing b/c he is ashamed of what he did or the crazy other women could have his cell phone and is texting it without his knowledge.  Anyways good luck and if you do happen to find another great guy in the mean time at least give them a chance maybe all of this just happened for a reason.
my uncle recently divorced my aunt,took the children now his family wants her out of the house she's living in my uncle have been with alot of women whilst being married and recently he found another woman and asked her to marry him she agreed,he later told my aunt that he wanted to get a divorce cause he is in love with someone else as soon as she signed the divorce papers he took the children to live with him in the usa cause she lives in the caribbean, now the family wants to throw her out of the house she is living in,now he is not giving her any thing he doesnt send her any money, she has no where to go and no family around to help her,what she is working for cant even pay rent so what should she do? looks like she was an idiot and signed divorce papers without a lawyer. They probably said that he had full custody and she got nothing. Otherwise she needs to take him to court. But is she already signed everything away good luck.\n\nNever sign any important papers without a lawyer.
What is the proper way to measure your waistline? Yesterday on Oprah, "Dr. Oz" was plugging his new diet book.  He and his colegue followed two women to show how succesful their new diet program is.  When measuring one of the women's waist, Dr. Oz kept telling her to "suck it in".  After three "suck it in's" he measured her waist and said that measurement was her waist size.(?)  Well, if I do that, I'm back to my girlish 24(!!) but if I don't do that, then I am a 27.  (???) I have worked in several health clubs and responsible for measuring many womens waist lines, you are right, the proper way to measure is to have the woman standing normally, not "sucking in". This "doctor" should check his facts before going on national tv and making himself look foolish

He exploits Othello�s weakness, bringing out his fatal flaw of jealousy and making him believe that Desdemona and Cassio are having an affair. During the course of the play, Iago kills Roderigo and Emilia, his wife; and he stabs Cassio, wounding his leg. His evil scheming leads to the deaths of Desdemona and Othello. \n\nhttp://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmOthello04.asp\n\nGood luck.\n\nKevin, Liverpool, England.
Should GHW Bush have stayed with his plane? Or was he following procedure when he bailed out and let his crew fend for themselves.\n\nI've read accounts that say he was wrong in bailing out and letting his crew crash into the ocean (they all died)..  If he was wrong in deserting his crew, how did he avoid a court-marshal?\n\nNo malice here, just an honest question, ok? his fathers money, he paid his way.

ever use magnums? I'm about 7.5 length x 5.75 girth and feel that regular condoms suffocate my penis.  Has anyone around my size noticed this as well and do u use Magnums?  Are they better? I've used Trojan magnums. They're very comfortable. Just a bit wider. I don't need the length, but wider doesn't pinch the base of my old boy.

How does drinking salt water dehydrate a person through osmosis?   Well basically in osmosis, there are 3 solutions: hypertonic,hypotonic and isotonic. Drinking saltwater causes a hypertonic solution in your cells. The most basic way to explain this is as you drink saltwater, the salt solutions gather outside your cells. No water comes in and the remaining water gets pushed out causing crenation, shriveling of the cell. You can see it externally when your hands wrinkle when wet for too long right? Imagine it acting through your internal organs so I think its kinda like dehydration from within, which is exactly what people try to avoid  when they drink saltwater out of desperation right? hehe.
Who Was A Better Rapper 2Pac Or Biggie?   2pac will always be timeless. Look at how many cds he sold since he has died. Biggie was great. Shakur is greater. He is the Biggest selling hip hop artist of all time, 38 million or better, and six albums alive while only nine after he passed on. Imagine how much new stuff he would have wrote had he lived. Put east coast west coast or democrat or republican aside and pick the best candidate. Tupac in 2006
A car can pump 500 gallons of gas in 20 minutes. How much gas can a car pump in 30 minutes?   These are just similar ratios:\n\n500 gallons / 20 minutes = x gallons / 30 minutes\n\n500 / 20 = x / 30\n\nNow solve for x (you can cross multiply if you like):\n20x = 15000\nx = 750 gallons.\n\nIt's also rather intuitive to see that you got 500 gallons in 20 minutes.  So in 10 minutes more, you will pump half again as much.  500 + 250 = 750 gallons.
key questions? My thesis statement is: A significant number of high school students drop out of school due to poor academic performance and poverty. Can you give a key question that would suit this statement? I have a few: What happens to the students who drop out? How does a high drop out rate affect the society at large? What places do high school drop-outs fill in our economy?
How many sheets of paper can you put in an envelope before you need another stamp?   one ounce worth, but if it is too bulky they will send it thru the spurs, bulky material that cannot go thru the machine, and the person on the other end will have to pick up the postage due. I'd say that if you have trouble folding them and getting them into an envelope and sealing the envelope, you'd best put on another stamp. 5-6 pages are about all that an envelope can handle, without putting it into the non-machinable stage.

How Do I..............................? My stomach is freakin skinny, but I need help on how to loose weight from my thighs and butt. Please help. What kind of exercise should I do??? Sorry to say this, but there's no such thing as spot reduction.  Different people carry and lose weight in different areas then others.  You're actually very lucky.  People that store more fat in areas away from the chest and midsection are much less likely to have heart and other weight related problems.  I'd just perform exercises and cardio that focus on the legs and butt to help tone those areas, and make sure to eat healthy.
When will the repubs understand that an election is really only worth having if there's more than one person How wearisome has been the tactic of this adm. and their ilk to mute any disagreement with them.

what is a rhombic section?   A rhombic section is a term used mostly in the field of geology. If you cut a rock in half to see a cross section of it, if you find the plane at which you had cut it to look like a rhombus, you have a rhombic section. The term is also used in the topic of feldspars.
Where is Shang-rila? What is your definition of Utopia? Is paradise an island sandbar in your mind? or a house and a home in the burbs? What is paradise? Shangri-la is an imaginary land depicted in the novel Lost Horizon (1933) by James Hilton.\nA remote beautiful, imaginary place where life approaches perfection: utopia.\nMy definition of utopia is a place without violence, or fear, no one is hungry, no one has worries, everyone is happy, healthy, and we all live in harmony.  My idea of paradise? Bhutan, in northern Himalaya.
I have two computers, but one printer and Internet cable, how can I print from other computer?   You have two options, network, or plug and play.\n\nFor networking, it takes more time to setup though may be more efficient in the long run. You will need to connect the two computers together with your network cable and on both computers, go to Control Panel and set up a home network. Make sure to have your printer connected to the host computer.\n\nFor plug and play, it is much more easy and may only take one a two seconds longer in the long run. Just install the printer driver on both your computers and plug the USB connection to the computer you want to print from. The downside to this method is that both your computers and printer have to be located close to each other.
What is Combined Honours? How do you define it? and how much harder is it than just taking a single. I did a Double Honours degree; you do the 'core' of two majors, rather than a major and a minor. Thid adds up to more time and longer essays than a major and minor, and takes quite a lot of self control (because you will have a favourite, but must remember that both are equally important and you need to spend equal time on both). \n\nMany people assume it is just a case of being a fast worker and having the correct 'academic' ability, but I would add time management and self-control/discipline to this. You have to be able to prioritise for yourself- if you have a major/minor at Uni, this is decided for you, but with a double hons it is down to your own willpower.

Celebrity Feet? OK, my last question's expiration date came and so I have to restart. Thanks to you guys, I have now have a list of good movies filled with good foot shots.\n\nHere' are ones I have answers to:\n\nTom Hanks: Cast Away\nKevin Costner: Waterworld and The Upside of Anger\nBruce Willis: Die Hard\nBurt Reynolds: Smokey and the Bandit\nHarrison Ford: Patriot's Game and What Lies Beneathe\nKevin Spacey: American Beauty\nMel Gibson: Lethal Weapon\nPierce Brosnan: The Thomas Crown Affair\n\nWell, you get the point. Thanks guys and here's another list to help me with.\n\nTim Robbins\nDavid Odgen Stiers\nTom Arnold\nKevin Spacey\nBruce Willis\nRobert DeNiro\nJeffery Tambor\nMichael Caine\nPatrick Stewart\nTom Hanks\nIan McKellen\nHarrison Ford\nEddie Izzard\nAnthony Hopkins\nJohn Cleese\nWilliam H.

Foot fetish? I have a whole roll of pictures of my feet while taking a roller coaster. Of course that wasn't on purpose, I just happened to be so tense that I had a death grip on the camera and part of it was activating the shutter. I also have a great picture of my foot going down the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon. We were going through some rapids so the picture ended up being of my foot instead of the rapids, etc. Anyhow, I ramble. \nThe most glaring things I see in your second list are that most of these guys are getting old, are or have been very famous and wealthy, are in good shape for their ages and are quite popular. As for specifics, that sounds like a lot of writing, and you probably know more about them than I. Of course you know Burt Reynolds has had a toupee for almost 30 years, right?
George Bush?   http://cronus.com/bushresume/\n\n\n\n\nGeorge W. Bush: My Resumé\n Arrest Record, Crimes & Misdemeanors:\no  Two negligent collisions, July & Aug 1962 at Houston TX. Fined. (Page 20 of linked PDF document)\no  Two speeding tickets, July & Aug 1964 at Houston TX. Fined. (Page 20 of linked PDF document)\no  Arrested for Disorderly Conduct, December 1966 at New Haven CT. Charges were dropped. (Page 20 & 37 of linked PDF document)\no  Arrested for Disorderly Conduct in New Jersey, in 1967. I was cautioned and set free. \no  At least one conviction for drunk driving in Maine when I was 30 years old, where I pled guilty, was fined and suspended from driving. \n\nPast work experience:\no  Ran for congress and lost.\no  Served for a decade on the board of a company that financed several R-rated, slasher and sundry B movies.\no  Bought an oil company and generated an astounding $3.1 Million debt, sold the company to another Texas oil baron, and then sold it again to my dad's Saudi friends and made over $1.5 Million from the sweetheart deal. I sold all my stock just in the nick of time, using insider information, to a wealthy Saudi friend of my father.\no  Bought a small portion of the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that forcibly took land using eminent domain and tax-payer money. Most notable decision: Traded Sammy Sosa to the White Sox for Harold Baines. Most notable profiteering: Parlayed a $605K loan into a $14.9 Million profit using taxpayer money and eminent domain laws to evict homeowners, obtain land and increase the value of the shares in the Texas Rangers.\no  Elected to governorship of Texas, with the help of George Bush Sr. and generous donations and support from wealthy oilmen and Christian evangelicals.\n\n Accomplishments While Governor of Texas: \no  Relaxed pollution laws for power and oil companies (I "grandfathered" the dirtiest coal burning power plants, making them exempt from clean air laws, for example) and made Texas the most polluted state in the Union, in 1999. I invited polluters to write Texas's environmental policies, a theme that I carried on into the WhiteHouse after I was selected President. The same year, Houston had the "highest ozone level reading in the nation", and was second most ozone polluted city in the country from 1997 through 1999.\no  Slashed taxes, reduced state revenue to the point of bankruptcy and put the Texas government in debt for billions in borrowed money, the interest for which is now paid for by the Texas taxpayer.\no  Set a record for the most executions by any Governor in American history and became famous for publicly mocking Faye Tucker, a Christian female death row inmate, for her passionate clemency plea before she was executed. \n\n\no  Appointed US President, on a questionable decision by a highly partisan Supreme Court, after losing the popular vote by over 500,000 votes.\n\n Accomplishments While US President:\no  I attacked and invaded two countries so far, losing more US soldiers after I claimed "Mission Accomplished" than the total number who were killed during full combat operations in both wars combined.\no  I spent the largest surplus in the history of the country and nearly bankrupted the treasury. \no  I shattered records for the biggest annual deficit in history. \no  Set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in a 12 month cycle of any presidency, beating the previous record which was set during the depression years. \no  Set all-time record for biggest loss of value in the history of the stock market during any presidency ($5 Trillion drop equalling a 27% drop in investor stock portfolios from the date of my inauguration). \no  First president in decades to execute a federal prisoner. \no  First president in US history to enter office with a criminal record. \no  First year in office set the all-time record for most days on vacation by any president in US history and continued that practic
do you support bush? and if you do why? Yes, I support President Bush. He is doing a better job than anyone he ran against in either election could ever dream of doing. I think that it is unfair that people blame him for the false intelligence he received before going into Iraq. (I only hope that if a Democrat ever makes it back to the Oval Office, that all the "Government Conspiracy Theorists" will give that person's administration the same skepticism.) The fact of our situation now, that we are in Iraq, makes the false intelligence obsolete. I support Bush in "staying the course." I know that the Democrats' hearts are in the right place, but their planned troop redeployment could have devastating effects on our troops. Senator George Allen (Rep. VA) made a good point today during the Senate vote on the two proposals for troop redeployment when he said it is never good strategy to tell your enemies what you are going to do. That is the whole point, to me, against giving a time line on our troops in Iraq. If we broadcast to the insurgents the day we plan to leave, they will know that the day after that,  they can begin destroying all the hard work the Coalition forces and Iraqis have accomplished since the ousting of Saddam. The troops need to stay until the Iraqi government feels secure enough in its ability to defend its own people. One good thing could come out of the recent Congreesional debates over this issue. Hopefully someone within the Iraqi government was watching the debates. Both sides of both houses of the U.S. Congress stressed the importance of the Iraqis need to defend themselves. That is the key to troop removal. The people of Iraq need to realize that they have the opportunity to create a real democracy. The different sects need to stop squabbling and join together and build a secure Iraq together. They need to make it clear to the insurgents that they want to have their country back. It is up to the Iraqis to fight back against the terrorist element that is perpetuating the stay of Coalition forces.

Where do you think? Waldo is?  No - how about Osama bin Laden?  Anyone remember him?  No news about "looking" for him anymore - wonder why? Where's the best place to hide? Right under someone's nose.  My theory is he's had plastic surgery, shaved and flew right on over here to join us in the United States!!  He has the $$ means.  What are you thoughts? Doesn't it kind of anger you that it's all been like - forgotten about - at least that is the way it appears anymore. Osama Bin Laden lives in the white house.  This is my belief because whenever 9-11 first happened and president bush sat there like a dumb dick, the first thing he did was flew Sadam husein's family to a safe place.  I don't understand why people still believe that we should be over there "fighting the war in iraq".  There is nothing more to do.  We are just gonna keep losing our troops.  What the predisent needs to do is send his troops over to where the real disaster was, (Huricane Katrina) and clean some stuff up.  I wish the president would actually pretend like he cared about someone other than himself and the rich people.

Are you a mountain climber? I'm interested in being one. My fitness level isn't that good because I sit on my a$$ all day but I'm willing to work hard. How fit should I be so that I don't die on my first try? Do you mean a rock climber? These folks are awfully darn fit.\n\nIf you mean mountain hiking, most guidebooks rate trails for level of difficulty. There are easy walks up gently sloping fire roads. Then there are steep hands and knees scrambles up steeply sloping narrow ledges with a 600 foot drop on one side. \n\nYou might want to talk to the www.rei.com free outdoor advisers about either rock climbing or mountain hiking.

If the individual links of the track of a "bulldoser" --- while they are on the ground? do not move, does this mean that the links on TOP of the chain are moving twice as fast as the machine moves? You are correct.  The tracks are powered by cogged wheels driven by the engine and work like the wheels of a car except they run along the track instead of the road bed.  Look at the wheel when it is moving.  The bottom point is momentarily fixed to the ground and the top point is moving straight ahead with a momentary velocity.  The axel which is half way between the top and bottom is traveling at the average velocity:\n\nVelocity (axel) = (Vtop + Vbottom)/ 2 = (Vtop + 0)/2 = 1/2 Vtop\n\nThe machine moves at the speed of the axel; proving your point.\n\nAn even better illusion is the fact that when a locomotive speeds down a track, part of it is always moving backwards (hint: the part of the wheel flanges below the top surface of the track!).

How do I deal with a Mad Scientist neighbor? Ok...I have a buddy in my building.  He's a decent fellow, kinda plain-looking, dirt-poor, but really smart....problem is, he's also really lonely.  And he has a weird hobby...since he's too shy to get himself a real-life, face-to-face girlfriend (and he is straight as far as I know), he's got this hobby, or obsession...he dreams of ways to find and seduce a willing woman...so he can turn her into a living doll. Like a living Barbie, or china doll, or something.  Yes, he's on meds and got help for this, it seems mostly a harmless fantasy life he has going....but is there anything I can do to help him out before he buys a LabCoat? tell him to go to \nrealdoll.com they have these dolls that look real and he can make her do what he likes with out hurting anyone...only problem is they are like $7000.00...but hey over the years a real girl will be a lot more expensive...they look so real,it's trippy...

At what point would you find yourself voting for the party opposite of your basic cons/lib bearing? Is it possible or do you just blindly vote the party line on the basis that they MUST be right?  I watched my grandfather vote democrat all his life mearly out of respect for all FDR did to help his family survive the depression.  My father on the other hand has voted straight republican all his life based mearly on his career in the business world and his belief that the republicans helped him.  When do you cross the party line? The answer is that we do away with the party system ALTOGETHER and create an Independent political system. As long as America takes its "team mentality" from the sports field into the political arena and votes based on a "label", this country can only go even further down than it already is. When people start voting issues instead of party affiliation, candidate popularity contests, or advertising dollars, we can reclaim this country with leaders of fairness and a vision for the true equality of ALL Americans.\n\nOur votes are stolen (See 2000 and 2004 elections), the elected officials care more about "job security" than their constituents (government was to be "service" NOT a career path!), and "We The People" suffer in the long haul. Don't cross party lines to vote--BE INDEPENDENT and vote the issues close to and for the good of "normal" Americans.

what is a typcial day in life of a analyst?   My husband is an analyst.  He gets up usually around 5-5:30 AM, makes coffee for me, lets the dogs out, brings the coffee up to me and checks our personal stocks on one computer and turns on his laptop to check out what is happening at work.  He sits on his laptop watching transportaion flows all over the US, checks weather to determine whether that will have an impact on shipments, answers e mails, his cell phone and pagers to solve problems and feeds the dogs between 8:30 and 9:00AM.\n\nThen he gets back on his computer and does the same thing until about noon when he takes his shower, asks me to help him pick out a tie for the suit and shirt he's wearing that day, packs up his laptop and goes into the office.\n\nWhile at work, he trains people on the programs that they are not using correctly, procedures they are not following and makes presentations about the same.  He also does evaluations and follow-up reports on large accounts that include suggestions and recommendations on what could have been done better and what was done well. \n\nThen around the time Oprah comes on, he calls me to ask if there is anything he needs to pick up at the market so I can make dinner, stops by the market and comes home around 6:00-6:30 PM to a wonderful delicious gourmet dinner.  \n\nHe is, however, on 24 hour call so often has to answer his cell or return calls if there are any emergencies.  Usually, we take a spa after dinner, put on our jammies, watch some TV and go to bed around 9:00-9:30PM.  Oh, we let out the doggies before retiring.\n\nHe's worked for his company for 40 years since he was in high school, is well compensated and really loves his job.

How old do you have to be to take boater's safety?   Red Cross boating safety can be taken at age 12, and it's a great idea for any new boater, regardless of age. They should also ensure that they can swim. It's amazing to me the number of people who go boating who don't even posses survival swimming skills, like being able to tread water! A life jacket should be a supportive device, not your sole safety device. \nBut enough of my ranting. To go back to your original question, 12 years of age. \nGo for it!
Where in the Bible, does it talk about Guardian angels ?   I believe "imacatholic2" answered your question very well and they were right to reference the Catechism of the Catholic Church because it covers all bases including biblical references in case you are one of those that say, "If it isn't in the Bible it doesn't exist.". You have to understand that the Bible doesn't always refer to some things by name, but by reference. Just like there are many references to a place where souls go to be purified before entering Heaven, even though the actual word "Purgatory" is not mentioned. The Bible was not written originally in English, so we should not quibble over semantics to get to Truth. So it is with "Guardian Angels". That particular English phrase is not spelled out but the references are numerous, and "Imacatholic2" spelled them out clearly and beautifully. I am a Catholic, too. God bless you,

how long will the usa be involved in the war in iraq?   Everyone talks about ~us~ losing or ~us~ getting tired.  What about the bad guys?  Ever think ~they~ are losing, or ~they~ are getting tired?  We killed their leaders and reduced their ability to organize.  Once we can limit their presence to that of an American street gang (Bloods, Cryps, etc), which is happening as their reach gets more and more limited, the local police can deal with them and we'll be able to withdraw victorious.  Key word - victorious!!\n\nWithdrawing earlier, under worse conditions (i.e. we lose and they win) is an option, but it will still take over a year to fully withdraw.  It's not like we can snap our fingers and pull everyone home overnight.

Did Bush lie AGAIN?

Bush said... \n"We're fighting them over there, \nso we don't have to fight them here" \nSeems to me like we're fighting them\nhere, arn't we? Did he lie....again? Ofcourse he did!\nHe and his staff will say whatever they need to continue their minimal support, whatever feable support that may be, for a war based on a lie to begin with!

Please tell me some migratory birds, which come to india, anytime in the year.?   In India, most migratory birds start coming in from September (after the monsoons) and leave by April (or before the monsoons). The migratory birds come to India, to spend the winter because their breeding grounds are low on food, because it would be winter there and almost everything would be frozen. Most of the birds which comes to India are known to come from Europe and Central asia. Some of the famous ones include waterfowl like the Bar-headed Geese and eagles like the Steppe Eagle apart from several wading birds like the common Sandpiper and so on. \n\nWhile winter migrants are most common in India, there are also summer migrants. These are birds which come to India during the summer to breed. Most of them are local migrants (ex:- Indian Pitta), that is, migrate within India.
Is noon 12 am or 12 pm ?   aaahhh, now you know why i prefer "marine hours".  Noon, i.e. 12:00 on the dot is am, but one second after that is pm.  Similarly, midnight is 12:00 pm, but one second after is am.  I always find this extremely confusing because rather than thinking of the times as points on a clock, i tend to think more in terms of english grammar, where 12 is the subject, or main noun, if you will, and the minutes after are merely an adjective modifying the noun.  In this vein, it is am all the way up to 12:59:59 and switches to pm at 1:00 in the afternoon (and, of course, the reverse at midnight), which, of course, is exactly wrong.\n\nOh how i dearly wish the whole planet would kick the damnable am/pm habit and adopt marine hours.  12 is just 12, after which comes 13 and so forth until you get to 23:59:59, then you start all over again at 0.

Question for regular eBay users? I bought two items from a seller on June 21st, 2006. After sending four emails, I left negative feedback on June 27. Yesterday, June 28, I saw that he had left me negative feedback accusing me of being a "newbie who rushes to leave neg feedback" and that he had a "family emergency."\n\nNow that we've both left eachother negative feedback, will I still get the items I paid for? The seller should still resume sending you your item. If he doesnt, then you can always send in a complaint through ebay and your credit card company to refund you if you do not get your item within 1 month. \n\nYou were too quick to leave a negative feedback. When you leave a negative feedback, you will have to assume you will get one too. Those feedbacks represents your ebay reputation, so you should take that pretty seriously.\n\nUnless the seller refunds you manually, you should still be getting your item.\n\nNOTE: You can always withdraw your feedback by filling in a "feedback withdrawal" form through ebay. That way, both your negative feedbacks will get removed.

Why do Yahoo libs not understand that almost all deficits were caused by Democrats? Are they that dense? Do they not teach Civics in high school anymore? Congress, specifically the House of Representatives, is in charge of spending the money, not the President. Not any President ever.\n\nDemocrats controlled Congress for more than FOUR DECADES and in that time pitched record deficits nearly every year. What changed? In 1994 Newt Gingrich was elected Speaker of the House and FORCED through tax cuts that stimulated the economy and produced windfall revenue to the Treasury.\n\nI'll admit that it's true that the war combined with liberal-like Republicans in the current Congress ruined all of Newt's work, but why do Yahoo! liberals not understand that the budget surpluses in the 90's they're always spouting off about had NOTHING to do with President Clinton? To answer both questions:\n\nThat is not what Hilary told them to think.\n\nyes.

If languages evolved, how come there are no "half-languages"? Also, what use is half a language?\n\nAny intermediates would have been functionally useless. Uhm, there are. Many forms of Creole are found in the Carribean and Louisiana, all evolved from French into something more or less distinct. While similar enough to French that a French-speaker could usually understand the gist of what is being said in Creole and that a Creole speaker could make himself better understood with effort, it's separate enough that someone actually has to study the other to speak it fluently. Louisiana Creole takes this evolution from French further and incorporates some expressions from English.\n\n\nAnother half-languages you might be interested in is Luxumburgian, which evolved from a Dutch dialect with influences from French. Something possibly on the way to becoming a half-language is the difference between Quebecois French, which is similar to medieval French, and the more modern French spoken in France, and the deriviations found in western Africa. Another possibility is the differences between the various Englishes of the US alone. Can a Californian understand the heavy drawl of a Southerner or New Englander? Not easily, if at all, and I'm not even mentioning all the dialects of the British Isles.\n\nWhenever you see languages in the same family, they came from half-languages and sometimes still are effectively half-languages. Latin evolved separately in France, Spain, Italy, and Romania, though for a short enough time each was still only a regional dialect or half-language and could be understood by each other, especially if they made the effort to enunciate clearly. We can see the slow shifting of German as it went from the west to east through Europe, eventually becoming English. A German can sometimes understand the gist of Dutch even today with a lot of work, and vice versa.
Invasion??? I've heard that ABC has axed Invasion, do you think another network will take it on?  I'm in the UK and the first series has just ended!

Hannity or Colmes? Which one do you think is more reliable when it comes to "Facts" and honesty? They are both pretty equal, but Hannity is more inflamatory so I'll go with Colmes (and I'm a die hard conservative).  Remember they both have research staffs that try to verify what they present.  I'd say they both try hard to be on point.

What are some of the funniest questions on this Answer site? One of the funniest questions I read was "If I die a virgin will I have to spend an eternity with a suicide bomber?" lol...that is funny.

Will asteroid 2004 xp14 hit the moon on July 2nd this year? Huge Asteroid to Fly Past Earth July 3  SPACE.com/LiveScience.com via Yahoo! News, Jun 27 No chance, if it were even gonna be remotely close to hitting the moon, our "if it bleeds it leads" media would be on this 24-7 right up until it misses the moon, then they would jump all over the scientists that predicted that it wouldn't hit the moon about how inaccurate the prediction wasn't.    If that sounded like it was all jumbled up it was meant to be ( a poke at the useless media )
whats up with kids having sex?? i know a lot of kids; preteens and teens having sex...girls mainly. i ask them if they get anything out of it and they say no....why r they doing it then?? like i have this friend, and she kinda sleeps around with guys.....she doesnt get anything out of it when she has sex with them....no offense, but who wants 2 be sweaty, wet, and well, i guess, if sex has a smell,smelly and not get anything out of it?? not me, lol i know! that puzzles me. for a 13 year old to have sex is way too young! emotionally, they are not able to handle these things too well. and they're young, they're gullible.\nMEDIA -- is number 1 to be blamed -- sometimes i could see that there are things on TV that are not censored and kids would see this and think, it's ok.\nHORMONES -- is another thing. it is at this age when the body starts producing hormones. i remember when i was this age, it's like i wanted to bang any guy i see. but i went to a very strict school, and also i grew up in a strict religous upbringing. im kinda glad i waited to be an adult -- because you make better choices and these choices are not based on what you feel.\n\ni think it's disgusting to see 13 year olds having sex nowadays. if i were their mother -- they will give a whole new meaning to the word: WRATH
is it a sin that Yahoo!Answers suspended "krajlicatabiaa" from this site? krajlicatabiaa is/was one of my favorite regular anwerers on here. she always showed respect for everybody and showed a bright, funny and smart personality.\n\nshe got suspended from this site for asking a question in a foreign language.\n\n66% of her answers were chosen as best answers! I think she's a loss to the Yahoo!Answer community.\ni don't know her, but i always enjoyed her questions.\n\none of her questions, just as an example:\n\nhttp://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AslQDp1fy3jDur4Jto2U2PcgBgx.?qid=20060620211327AAzkzK9\n\ncould we all pray (or whatever) that God (or whoever) will make Yahoo! correct this obvious error?? The Yahoo! Gods have answered our prayers and seen fit to restore her...\n\nPractically speaking, I've often suspected that a lot of Yahoo!'s suspensions are automated. Probably whenever somebody reports abuse, it's added to a database, and after someone gets a certain number of reports, the computer automatically shuts down the account. This, of course, tilts the scales against long-term and well-known users, because sooner or later someone will report you. I think the system really prefers semi-anonymous figures who ask fact-based questions that don't require thought and give fact-based answers that don't show thought. Mediocrity wins out in the end.\n\nTwo suggestions I could make to Yahoo! would be to counterweigh abuse reports with the time someone's been on the site - someone who's amassed 20 abuse reports in 12 hours is clearly more of a threat than someone who's amassed 20 abuse reports over several months - and to offer some kind of counterbalance to abuse reports - something to accentuate the positive and not just the negative, like on eBay where feedback on a user can be positive or negative.\n\nBut Yahoo! is a private company and has the right to behave however they want... Our two choices are to accept it or walk away...\n\n----------\n\n(edit: A better question is why they haven't suspended someone like Sara F, who gives answers as ignorant as the one above...)

Why do people always badmouth Macs? Personally i think Macs are for grown ups.\n- My Mac has never crashed.\n- Networking is a snap.\n- Every piece of hardware i own (camera, film camera, zip drives, printers, etc.) have all worked seamlessly with my Mac.\n- All the Professional programs are made for Macs, not PC's (Adobe, Macromedia, Final Cut Pro, Pro Tools, etc.)\n- Most of the other programs have Mac versions\n- My Mac is faster than any PC i've sat down at (except a few self-built models)\n- The OS is much more user friendly.\n- Utilities are easy to manage and customize.\n- The Native Programs kick anything Windows offers\n\nI could go on. I don't care if you have a PC, but I don't like all these PC people answering negatively to valid Mac questions. It seems to me the only reasons you hate Macs is because you can't play those stupid games (which most of them, YOU CAN) and you can't download illegal files at most sharing sites.\n\nGrow up. Some like beer, some like wine, some just want a shot of liquor.\n\nIt really depends on your preference. People who love graphical design and likes the MAC interface will prefer MACs. I do admit, I have said in the past I think they are for boys and not Men...but I wasnt being rude about it. I just think the interface is very user friendly and all the features look cartoonish to me. When it comes to PC, they require more hands-on training and they are harder to configure so I think its something men like. Its a low level platform and it takes a person a lot of patience and knowledge to use one....a challenging concept for older generations.\n\nI got used to PCs. Ive had one for more than 10 years now. I used to have a MAC, but I just dont like the interface and the windows architecture on it. I can see why some might like it though. \n\nIts all preference and what youre used to. You wont get any linux users to like MACs....they are two totally different systems. \n\nSome like IE, some like Firefox. Dont you think its all about what they are used to and what they prefer?\n\nIf you ever looked at my past MAC answers, I always answer MAC questions seriously. I never make fun of them, they all serve the same purpose.

Who would your first five penalty takers be for England?   Sven has already chosen his penlties takers should he need them. He chose:\nFrank Lampard,\nDavid Beckham,\nMichael Owen \nand Stevie Gerrard as his first four, then \nAshley Cole, Owen Hargreaves or John Terry.\nNot a bad choice if you ask me! As long as he doesn't go for Crouch we should be fine! Sven even said he hadn't picked Crouch as a penalty taker but he got "caught in the moment" in the Jamaica game and allowed Crouch to take it.

I am a GEP boy :) Yes, Gene research as a double edge sword simply i would say the disadvantages and advantages of this noble area of science.For the sake of non science participants, Gene therapy is of great help to mankind effort in fighting disease, in understanding the underlining cause of sickle cell diseases and other metabolic diseases.Cloning is still a topic that generates interest between sciencist and non-scientist alike, in this area one would find that gene research is actually a double edge sword as gene modification could possibly lead to new diseases.
why is the country holland known as the netherlands?   The correct term is The Netherlands or Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in dutch,...it refers to (as you will see below in greater detail) low lands.  I lived in Belgium and it was called Pays Bas which means flat land.  We call it Holland in the U.S. but that is actually incorrect as it only refers to a small portion of the nation.  It is known by flat or low lands because it is primarily a flat country which is why flooding is such a major issue for them.\n\nBelow is some info from wikipedia:\n\nHolland is commonly used as a synonym for the Netherlands as a whole, while actually it just refers to the central-western part of the country. This part consists of two of the twelve provinces of the country, namely North Holland and South Holland.\n\nHistorically Holland was the most powerful district of the Netherlands: the counts of Holland were also counts of Hainaut, Flanders and Zeeland for several periods in the 13th-15th century; during the period of the Dutch Republic the stadholder of the Holland was the most powerful politician in the Netherlands, and he often also was stadholder in other provinces; the cities in Holland were important trading cities, for instance six cities in Holland made up the Dutch East India Company. Still the two provinces, making up Holland, are very strong: they house 37.1 percent of the Dutch population.\n\nThe name 'Holland' is used in the Netherlands as well, especially in relation to soccer, where "Holland!" is shouted out loud by Dutch soccer fans. Furthermore do Dutch tour operators and tourist information centres use the term, because the name 'Holland' is better known worldwide.\n\nThe name Holland ultimately stems from "holt land" ("wooded land"). A popular, but incorrect, fake etymology holds that it is derived from hol land ("hollow land"), inspired by the low-lying geography of both the region.
My old man's a dustbin, he wears a dustbin lid.  Have I got my lyrics wrong here?   Yeah you do.  Here are the lyrics:\n\nMy Old Man's A Dustman\nLonnie Donegan\n\n[Derived from an old army tune] \n[Lyrics written by Lonnie Donegan]\n\n\nNow here's a little story \nTo tell it is a must\nAbout an unsung hero \nThat moves away your dust\nSome people make a fortune \nOther's earn a mint\nMy old man don't earn much\nIn fact....he's flippin'.....skint\n \nOh, my old man's a dustman \nHe wears a dustman's hat\nHe wears cor blimey trousers \nAnd he lives in a council flat\nHe looks a proper narner \nIn his great big hob nailed boots\nHe's got such a job to pull em up \nThat he calls them daisy roots\n \nSome folks give tips at Christmas \nAnd some of them forget\nSo when he picks their bins up \nHe spills some on the steps\nNow one old man got nasty \nAnd to the council wrote\nNext time my old man went 'round there \nHe punched him up the throat\n\nOh, my old man's a dustman \nHe wears a dustman's hat\nHe wears cor blimey trousers \nAnd he lives in a council flat\n \nI say, I say Duncan \nI 'er...I found a police dog in my dustbin\n(How do you know he's a police dog) \nHe had a policeman with him\n \nThough my old man's a dustman \nHe's got a heart of gold\nHe got married recently \nThough he's 86 years old\nWe said 'Ear!

What is the difference between a yeast infection and a bacterial infection?   A yeast infection is caused by the normal flora of the vagina and tends to cause white discharge and itching.  A bacterial infection is caused by a different type of organism.  It could be bacterial vaginosis, which is also a disturbance of the normal flora of the vagina.  Bacteria can also be transmitted by sex, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.  There are also some strains of bacteria that can infect the urinary tract, which causes pain with urination.  Your doctor will evaluate your history and your symptoms and probably do a urine test to check for urinary tract infections.  A yeast infection can be treated with an oral medication like Diflucan or a vaginal cream like Monistat.  Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, but the specific medicine depends on what type of infection you have.  Good luck!
What is the worst religion/sect/heresy/false idolism etc to come from the USA? please state from where you come from and why you think this. The worst heresy from any country is the Doctrine of Hate which is encompassed to some extent by every human being.\n\nI believe this because the Truth is Love, which is perfection. The opposite of love is hate. There can be nothing worse than the complete opposite of the Truth.\n\n(The worst heresy to come from the U.S. would have to be the "Building Fund.") \n\nRaleigh, North Carolina, USA
What did you think of the final Will and Grace Show?   I loved it.

Any tips for after Gastric Bypass Surgery? I am having surgery in couple months... Any comments or tips are welcome. I am a bit scared.. Shouldn't be a big problem. It's a little hard to get your food down to begin with. you want to take small bites, chew real good and flush with water. It's nearly impossible to belch and vomit. After a while when it's all healed and the swelling gone, thing start getting back to some semblance of normal but it takes several months to really feel normal again. Don't worry about it, it really isn't that bad.

Does anybody really love there job or career? I'm 21 yrs. old and all I've ever really wanted to do was sing and dance for a living.  I don't want to be a starving artist and I realize that this won't pay the bills if I don't get lucky.  I want to go back to school, but I don't know of anything else that would make me happy.  Does anybody have any suggestions for me?  Or can you at least tell me if you love your job what it is that you do? Absolutely!!!! I am an emt and ems dispatcher for a large hospital based ems service. I can't think of anything more exciting or rewarding. I didn't always feel that way. I went from one dead end job to another until I finally stumbled into this one. I can't imagine myself doing anything else. Just keep your eyes open and nose to the grind stone. Best of luck and work hard toward your goals and passions, and don't ever let anybody put you down for your dreams, but don't be too quick to pass on opportunities as they come your way. You're still young and you don't know what life may have in store for you. Break a leg.

who thinks david(calimity )james should be in the england team? he is useless. I'd pick him if it came to a penalty shoot out - he's the best shot blocker in England - it's just the rest of goalkeeping (handling crosses, positioning at free kicks, getting caught out of his area etc) he's rubbish at.  He also has a better chance of actually scoring a penalty than many of the England outfield....

What causes some animals to be attracted to some people? and not to others.? I was just wondering, about that because in the past I have had at different kinds of animals attracted to me.

What are booster shots for? What's the use of them? Booster shots are given to children in order to "boost" their immune systems. Before the children have the shots they have no defense against many of the common illnesses or those that have been detrimental to our society in the past. By giving them these shots, the children are exposed to the sickness so that their bodies can produce antibodies for that disease or illness. This leads to a healthy child!

When Jimmy Swaggart was caught paying a prostitute to watch her act.Was that a sin or just bad consumerism?

If you had two million dollars what would you do? Whom ever has the most responsable answer gets ten points. First, I'd pay off my debts. All of them. Then I'd pay a few things several months and/or years in advance, because I'd like to avoid being another 20 grand in the hole, if you don't mind. \nThen I'd buy myself a home and a car, and shoot some cash to my parents for putting up with me & my BS for so many years.\nNext, maybe I'd seek out some of my friends who need some help.....more morally than monetary, and help them do the same things I'd just done for myself. And set up some college/trust funds for their kids.\nMaybe I could find some good organizations to donate some money & some time....like Habitat for Humanity or something. Maybe get in the school board's face around here, and tell them I'll do a little something with their budget, but in return they have to step up their curriculum & stop graduating idiots (I heard our schools are like 49th in the nation - HELLO). Maybe I'd travel the country & speak in schools about my lifestyle & where it got me (I'm a bad, bad girl).\nAnd somewhere in there I'd go do some crazy shopping & spa-type things, with a health club membership b/c I'm fat & lazy & that's gotta go. And put my own self through college to get a few degrees that might be worth something :-)

How many tons of water does an average hurricane pick up before dumping it on the ground when it hits land?

why is it that in some parts of S. America they are oil free?  Why can't Americans live like this?   They aren't 100% oil-free, it's just that alternative fuel (E85 ethanol most of the time) is offered at virtually every pump, or at least in Brasil. This was done via heavy government influence, something Americans don't usually like. But the answer that i love the most is that of Representative Dave Camp (Republican-MI) who said that it is, and i quote, "the current political air of washington right now is very against alternative fuel". When asked to specify if it was the executive office (ie the president and his men) he agreed that it was.

can u can help? i wanted to know about wretling history of Dara Singh, legendary wrestler from India. i want to know that throughout his career, what titles did he won and how many times? i can't find them. Dara Singh (born November 19, 1928) is a wrestler and film actor from Amritsar, Punjab (India) in India.[1] He was a well-known wrestler before he started acting in Hindi films in 1962.[2]\n\nHe is a former multi-timer World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion. Dara Singh has competed against some of the greatest names in wrestling history including the great Lou Thesz whom he defeated.\n\nDara Singh is from India's state of Punjab. Due to his physique [3] he was encouraged to study Pehlwani, an Indian style of wrestling, in the milked sand wrestling pits of India called akhara. Dara Singh was a favourite in wrestling tournaments in India. In addition to this he wrestled on invitation of the kings of various Indian princely states and wrestled frequently in haats and meals (fairs and carnivals). He also successfully competed against professional wrestlers in the United States.\n\nUpon his return to India he gained unprecedented popularity by having bouts of wrestling across the country in the 1940s and 50s. He than translated this to celluloid fame by making a large number of B grade films which had him in the lead. One of his noticeable finds was the actress Mumtaz. He then went on to 1980s and 90s T.V fame when he played the role of Hanuman in the television adaptation of the epic Ramayana. The series is amongst the most widely viewed in history. He has acted in over 100 films

Investing for retirement.? If my job has a 401 that matches some of what I put in....and Vangaurd has a tax-free IRA for retirement, which one should I put money into?   One taxes me but the other matches some of what I put in. I would favor the employer-matched 401K because it is free money and it reduces your current tax burden.Employer matching typically maxes out at some amount, so put in at least that much in order to get the most free money from them.Those extra funds will help your 401K grow faster throughout the life of the account.
does city trust bank plc in lagos nigeria really exist? if it does can I get a phone number to reach management there? If you are asking abut a bank in Nigeria, I am guessing that you have been approached by someone working a "419" scam - if you help them with their delicate financial problem, they will give you millions of dollars....  Do NOT give them any of your personal information (phone numbers, addresses, bank account numbers, social security number, etc.).  If you have already lost money, you can try contacting the US Secret Service, but it is unlikely you will ever see your money again.

what do you call the equipment that brings back the heartbeat of a person? it can be seen on different TV shows or movies...\nit is also used when a patient is soon to die... A defibrillator is a medical device used in the defibrillation of the heart. It consists of a central unit and a set of two electrodes. The central unit provides a source of power and control. The two electrodes are placed directly on or in the patient. The device is designed to deliver an electric shock to the patient, in an effort to stop ventricular fibrillation.  Ventricular fibrillation is a cardiac condition that consists of a lack of coordination of the contraction of the muscle tissue of the large chambers of the heart that eventually leads to the heart stopping altogether.\n\nAs you can see the defibrillator doesn't actually start a stopped heart, it only corrects the poor pumping action of the heart.

why write a business plan for a dynamic, changeable business?   Only as a road map, not necessarily to be followed.\n\nIn my experience with business plans, their main benefit is to help you think through the business before you start. It forces you to research the market, to know what to expect, the obstacles you will face. It is one thing to say "I want to start a clothing store" and another to be confronted with the realities of how to find manufacturers, how to get your clothing line to the stores, how will you compete, the question of production, the finances you  will need, etc.\n\nThe trouble with business plan stems from the assumptions you will make -- especially in the financial section. One of the common mistakes of entrepreneurs is to depict a very rosy prospect for their business -- which is fine, if it is true. They think they will sell this much; they think they can accomplish this much; they think they can do all the marketing plans they've thought of; they think that they can get the financing they want. Then they start the business and find that the demand for their products is not what they anticipated; hence their revenue and sales figures fall short of what they assumed in the business plan. \n\nBusiness plans end up useless because of the erroneous assumptions made. More so with a dynamic, changeable business.\n\nDo a business plan mainly for the purpose of getting financing.
How do I remove S3 Pro Savage DDR from my PC?  For good...? I installed a new video card in my PC... Now I spend way too much time un-installing S3 Pro Savage DDR and all of it's software needs at start up. My PC reloads it every time I re-start. Also it is still taking up 32MB of memory. ;-(  Help! Most likely, what happened is you installed the new video card without removing the old one first and all of its components.  Try putting the S3 back and uninstall everything then shut down and put the new one in.  If that doesn't work then try this.\n\nRun --->  Regedit\n\nGo here to see if any startup is on for S3\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#92;SOFTWARE&#92;\nMicrosoft&#92;Windows&#92;\nCurrentVersion&#92;Run\n\nIf so, remove it/them...\nPress F3 and find S3 Or Pro Savage and delete everytime you find a Reg Key.
in php, what is the difference with .= after $disp as opposed to just the equal sign? I mean \n$disp .=\n\nas opposed to\n$disp = PHP has a operator that allows the user to join two variables together. And that operator is a dot (.)\n\nSo if you have this: \n==============================\n<?php\n$disp = 'Hi ';\n$disp .= 'm0';\nprint $disp;\n?>\n==============\n\nThe above will print:\nHi m0\n\nWhen we say equal it is intializing that variable to that. like\n====\n$a = 1;\n$b = 2;\n====\nSo if I print out a it will be 1 or if I prinf out b it will be 2.\n\nIf I say:\n====\n$a = 1;\n$c = $a.'3';\nprint $c;\n====\nThat will print out  13\n\nYou could have other forms of operators such as:\n===\n$a =1;\n$a += 2;\n=== \na will print out 3 since (a += b) is the same as   a = a + b;\n\nThe correct word for it would be concatentation between variables, the other operators like - or + are only valid for numbers integers.\n\nGood luck on your quest.

I need a new hobby. Suggestions? For over 2 years I have been blogging, I played Utopia and Adventure Quest... and even tried photography. Now I'm bored and I want something new. Can anyone give me some ideas/links? Photography is an awesome hobby and can be started (especially these days with digital cameras and inexpensive computers) for very little money.  There is something about capturing a moment and being able to hold onto it forever.\n\nCollecting is a great hobby and you can easily collect something that appeals to you.  I used to collect comic books, but others collect stamps, or postcards, or bugs (ewww), or a wide variety of things.\n\nDecorating, now that's a hobby.  You can always find something in your house to decorate, or even elsewhere such as outside (landscaping) and it can be done in a house, an apartment, or just about anywhere.\n\nBeads are fun and you can make a lot of fun things such as necklaces or bracelets.\n\nReading is fun.  You can go on a bender and just start reading like mad.  Fiction, non fiction, fun and contemporary or even serious drama and the like.  The classics are great and by reading them you can be involved in a lot of conversations.  It also gives you some insight into the creation of many modern words and sayings.\n\nTake photography to another level and make your own films.  An inexpensive video camera and an apple (yes I'm biased) and you can make some fun awesome movies.\n\nAnd, I know this is way out there, but volunteering is truly an amazing thing to do.  Not only will you be keeping yourself busy and learning various skills, but you will be helping your brothers and sisters of the world.\n\nYou can volunteer in so many ways, from the simple act of helping feed the homeless or organizing the food bins at a local food shelter, to helping in the building of houses, helping at fund raisers, manning phones (why not womaning phones?), or just about anything else.\n\nI hope that you find a hobby that suits you and brings you joy.\n\nLove as always,\n\nSebastian
hot then cold? when i am standing up i'm cold and when i lay down i get hot all over. i'm not covered up. just when i lay down or lean back i get hot. what could this be? does anyone know what it could be. \nif you have any ideas let me know.\ni'm not sick I don't know what it could be, but to prevent it, wear sweaters and such when you intend to stand for awhile, and simply wear underwear or shorts and a tanktop to bed with a fan/AC blowing on you for sleeping.
I think I might have a UTI?  Could someone help me out here, please? I have had a Urinary Tract Infection 2 or 3 times before (mind you, I'm almost 15), but I've never known it before I went to the doctor for something else and I had to do a urine sample. So that's why I'm not sure if I have one now or not. Anyway, for the past 2 or 3 days I have pain when I urinate, but the pain is awful immediately after. The pain is near my lower pelvis, and I mean the pain is BAD, where I have to just stand still and walk carefully because it hurts so bad. Does this just happen sometimes, could it be because I should be starting my period soon? Or should I go to a doctor? Thank you so much for your help! Go to a doctor!!

why Castro is more popular than any us president, even though he is socialist?   Castro is more popular than any other US President because his philosophy is rooted in fighting for the rights of the poor and under-served in society.  More than 80% of the world is made up of hard-working but marginalized people who need a leader to champion their causes, such as fighting for a living wage, universal healthcare, etc.  This is what Castro, Che Guevarra, and Hugo Chavez champion.  They work for the common people -- not for multi-national corporations.  That's why he's more popular.

I've noticed this about England.? In the Cup this year, I've noticed that England has been called seriously under-ranked in the FIFA matchcast chat. However, they've won every game, no matter how unimpressive they've been. \n\nI think England is only useing just enough energy to win it's first stage matches to save energy for the second stage. Their latest match against TRI proved that if they really try, they can be awsome.\n\nIs this a possability or am I just over annalysing things again? i agree with you. their opponents have no chance to stop england winning the world cup

If you send a certified letter how do you know it was or wasn't received? I sent a certified letter this past Friday to someone living in my town and I have not received confirmation that they got the letter--it is now Tuesday.  I heard that I am supposed to receive a post card in the mail telling me that they received the letter but so far nothing.  I probably have this under the wrong category, just didn't know which one to pick. Receiving a receipt back once the letter was delivered isn't "certified mail".  The service you should have purchased if you wanted that was "return receipt requested".\n\nHowever, the stub which was given to you by the post office has a tracking number on it.  You can either call 1-(800)-ASK-USPS and check on it, or you can go to:\n\nhttp://www.usps.com/shipping/trackandconfirm.htm?from=home&page=0035trackandconfirm\n\nFrom there, you can enter your tracking number and find out the current status of the letter you mailed.  =)

A lot of people are angry at our government (US), but what are YOU doing to change things? Or do you think it's a hopeless cause that you can't have any affect on? Seems to me there is a lot of complaining, but nobody does anything to initiate change. I, for one, am trying to get the word out to anyone and everyone about a third party I believe strongly in - the Constitution Party - since both the right and left wing have pissed me off too many times. May not seem like much, but at least I'm trying.\n\nCheck out the link if you're interested.\n\nwww.constitutionparty.com It is part of the duty of citizenship to communicate with our elected officials to give them our opinion.  They may not take the advice (and they are doing for us as they consider proper) but sometimes maybe a constituent can provide information the official may need to help with a decision.  I agree the system is hurting.  The best answer for a third party (and I am interested in groups like  the Constitution Party) is to start with some local elections and build from there.  They don't have the juice to make it on the national stage yet, I fear.

Why people that never have serve in the military or have been in a combat situation always are criticizing? our military specially those liberals that never have done nothing for their lifes other than smoke pot and drink wierd coffee at starsbucks.\n\nTHIS QUESTION IS COURTESY OF THE BOYS IN THE 3th BN 75th RANGER REGIMENT\n"RANGERS LEAD THE WAY" The criticism of the military on this site are from two different sources.  The first is from other Americans who are ignorant of how they are able to maintain the freedoms that they take for granted.  These are the same idiots that think all military personnel are murderers.  They will go on rants about how the president is a tyrant rather than making an informed intellectual argument.  They are not worth the time or energy because they don't have the intelligence to research a topic before running their mouths.  The second is from some foreigners that have had nothing but the extremely liberal media to use to gain an understanding of US policy.  Not all (nor even the majority of) foreigners are like this but you'll notice a lot of the critics on this site that are trashing our military are doing so in broken English.\n\nDon't waste your time worrying what either of these types of people say!  It is because of our military that they have the freedom to say it at all, but you are never going to get them to admit it!\n\n"AIRBORNE"

what is the biggest mlb ballpark?   Coors Field, located in Denver, Colorado is the home field of the National League's Colorado Rockies. It is named for the Coors Brewing Company of Golden, Colorado, which purchased the naming rights to the park prior to its completion in 1995. The Rockies played their first two seasons, 1993 and 1994, in Mile High Stadium before moving to Coors Field, two blocks from Union Station in Denver's Lower Downtown (or LoDo) neighborhood. The park includes 63 luxury suites and 4,500 club seats.\n\nCoors Field has a reputation as a home run-friendly park that, arguably, equals Chicago's venerable Wrigley Field. Though the fences are actually more distant than in most other facilities, the high altitude of the city (which is indeed about one mile above sea level), decreases air resistance on batted balls. Perhaps even more significantly, the low air pressure also causes pitches to break less severely and hence be easier to hit. Other factors include the relatively low height of the fences and very limited foul territory area.\n\nDue to Coors Field's location on Blake Street and its propensity for giving up home runs, Rockies players are informally called the "Blake Street Bombers."\n\nCoors Field was originally planned to be somewhat smaller, seating only 43,800. However, after the Rockies' first season, plans were altered during construction, and new seats, mostly in the center field bleacher section, were added. This section has its own informal name: "the Rockpile."\n\nWhile most of the seats in Coors Field are dark green, the seats in the 20th row of the upper deck are purple. This marks the city's one mile elevation point.\n\nThe only no-hitter at Coors Field was thrown by Hideo Nomo on September 17, 1996. Another game of note was the 1998 MLB All-Star Game.\n\nThere have been two 1-0 games in Coors Field history: July 9, 2005, when the Rockies beat San Diego and April 16, 2006, when the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Rockies.\n[edit]\n\nExternal links\n\n    * Ballpark Digest visit to Coors Field\n    * Ballparks of Baseball\n    * Coors Field images and information\n    * Aerial photo of Coors Field from Microsoft TerraServer\n    * Aerial Views of Coors Field, StadiumFind.com\n\n\nPreceded by:\nMile High Stadium\n1993–1994 Home of the\nColorado Rockies\n1995–present Followed by:\nCurrent\n\nCoordinates: 39°45′23″N, 104°59′39″W
Can you people help me come up with a badass name for a football team, must be plural? just a name that sounds totally badass not necesarily cool but badass please and thankyou The Wolverine's\n\nWe are noted for the following traits: \n\nStanding Our Ground \nFierceness \nElusiveness \nCleverness \nStrength \nEndurance \nCourage \n\nReal wolverines are so badass the football team can't even have the real ones on the side line in cages \n\nIn 1927, 10 wolverines were obtained from Alaska and placed in the Detroit Zoo. On big football days, two of these wolverines were brought to Michigan Stadium and carried around in cages. \nHowever, the animals grew larger and more ferocious, and as Yost states, " It was obvious that Michigan mascots had designs on the Michigan men toting them, and those designs were no means friendly." Therefore the practice of bring wolverines into the stadium had to be discontinued after only one year. However, one of the wolverines was not returned to the zoo. Instead "Biff" was put in a cage at the University of Michigan Zoo where students were able to visit him at times. In 1937, the Chevrolet Motor Company donated a wolverine (as well as a cage to keep it in), to the University of Michigan. It was unclear how long this wolverine lasted, but it is known that no live wolverines have been in the stadium in the last half century. \n\n\nIf a Wolverine was the size of a bear it would be the strongest animal on the planet.\n\nI know what you should absolutely not name your football team\n\nThe Spartans.... Sparta was the queen the ancient city was named after, her husband was the name of the whole territory. Do you really want to be thought of as someones little sister?...lol

I cycle a hybrid but want to switch to a proper road bike. Which would be a good, cheap entry level brand? I cycle in London and commute to work. But enjoy cycling fast!\nI'd like a bike that's basic, but good enough to upgrade later on.\nHopefully something not too stiff - south london roads are rough! I actually preferred a mountain bike with the narrowest semi-slick tyres I could find for riding regularly in London traffic, but thankfully I don't have to do this anymore. It looked strange with Marzocchi race forks, but had a good riding position, was fast, could jump over traffic islands and I never had an on-road accident on it in years of London (ab)use.\n\n Commuting just under 40 miles a day outside London, I used to mainly use an Italia fixed wheel machine from Condor in Grays Inn Road. This was practically maintainance free and very unattractive to thieves - the complete bike with aluminium frame and carbon forks should be around £600. This was also a wonderful bike for 50 mile training runs on a sunny spring morning and I even used it for youth hostelling.I had great fun on it until my knees gave out - and I'm not blaming that on the bike. The same frameset and forks with a Mirage groupset will cost around £800. A couple of clip on crud guards will make it more practical in British weather.\n\nF W Evans have several branches in South London and a huge stock of 2005 models at discounted prices. Check out http://www.evanscycles.com/ for details. They sell quality gear and the staff are enthusiastic and knowledgable - recommended.\n\nPersonally, I'd scour the ads in Cycling Weekly - I picked up a second hand pro level custom built cyclocross bike here for £500 at a time when the new frame and forks alone would have cost £650. Quality wheels plus Dura Ace and other top end components would have taken it way out of my price range new, but second hand it was cheaper than many entry level bikes. This has prooved to be an amazingly practical bike for everyday use with the addition of an USE suspension seatpost and using 32 mm tyres. There's plenty of clearance to fit clipon guards for road use in winter and it's an awesome tool for blasting down bridleways and canal towpaths in three seasons a year. Mine was made in 853 by a Manchester based firm called Atom.\n\nSteel will be more comfortable than aluminium and you can afford decent steel if you're buying second hand. Anything that fits you and has a Reynolds 531, 653 or 853 frame will be suitable, as would bikes using equivalent Italian steels from Deda or Columbus. The best all round compromise for speed, comfort and weather protection will be an audax bike. Anything by Chas Roberts, Bob Jackson, Brian Rourke or Condor is desirable and offerings from Mercian, Thorn, Ribble and Dawes are well worth investigating. Mine is a Condor which I bought new and there is no way I would want to part with it. It does everthing you want as long as you don't put much more than your wallet, passport, camera, keys, first aid kit and maps in the barbag - it gets twitchy on climbs when you're out of the saddle if you do. The only problem I've had is that the dynamo lighting system they fitted never did work, apart from in their workshop - I got so fed up with taking it in that I just gave up and scrapped it.\n\nI've just modified this after finishing training and hope it's of some small use. You know that whatever you choose is going to be the right choice. Just go for it and enjoy.

why do african americans complain so much. They have more chances of getting a job than whites. They're babies they have so many benefits.  All they do instead is moan and complain, they need to stop the B*tching and work in life, instead of taking the easy route out, on welfare, or as they call it "gang banging". You absolutly right us black people need to stop conplaining and need to take charge. Were the only ethcic group that has yet to rise up. And were the ethnis group with the least power(owning stores and politics) We need to stop trying to be rappers and basketball plays and we need to start thinking.
Are black people from Jamaica, Africa and American born blacks the same? There are some nice black people, but only very few, the majority of blacks try to be gangster, thus causing many problems which have plauged the average American city for years.

Another has to do with a sportswriter equating that 1901 Detroit club's opening day victory to the ferocity of his alma mater, the Princeton Tigers.\n\nHowever, the truth is revealed in Richard Bak's 1998 book, A Place for Summer: A Narrative History of Tiger Stadium. In the 19th century, the city of Detroit had a military unit called the Detroit Light Guard, who were known as "The Tigers." They had played a significant role in certain Civil War battles and also in the then-recently-fought Spanish-American War. The ballclub had informally acquired that nickname as a minor league club, but upon entry into the majors they sought and received formal permission from the Light Guard to use their trademark, and from that day forth the ballclub was officially the Tigers.\n\nIn short, the Tigers wore stripes because they were already Tigers, rather than the other way around which is the conventional story.
Why were hippies once perceived as a threat to life as we know it? I mean in the 60s, when conformity was considered best and females, minorities and 'different' people were mocked, maligned and ignored. I have my own theories, but how could anybody think that a hippie was a begining of the end of society? In a group, you need everyone working toward the same goal.  So if you introduce an element that hinders the effectiveness of the group to function ... that element is to the detriment of the whole.  That's what hippies were and are.\n\nAt least in the 60s the hippies wanted to start their own communal societies.  We could handle that, they were not such a hindrance to the mainstream society.  But today's hippies are far worse.  Now they want to stay within our mainstream society, enjoy the benefits of the group, but refuse to do anything productive themselves.
tanning at a tanning salon...read below please? I have been tanning at a tanning salon during the summers to get a base tan for the past 2 years.However, I have rarely experienced any burning at all until this year. Today I started tanning again and I was only in the bed for 9 minutes. Howerver I have a eally bad burn on my face and chest. I haven't recently started taking the pill and my friend said this might have something to do with why I burned. She said the pill is photosensitive and it is not reccomended that you tan while on it. What exactly does this mean and is she right. Could the pill be causing my skin to burn or is it possible that my skin is just changing on it's own? Please help I am not a doctor, but I do own a salon.  I refuse to buy a tanning bed for the reason that you have experienced.  The use of medications can cause burns, and even lead to cancer. Please be care full and use sunscreen in the sun every time.  I would suggest to stop using the tanning at all even in the sun.  I know that this is a sad way to live in the summer but you will live longer

In need of contact with others with dissociative disorder? I have bipolar disease but also have been diagnosed with dissociative disorder and have been losing time.  I need others to talk to that can understand what i'm going through.  Talk to me!  Talk to me! I have D.I.D. and have been seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist since 1992.  I have been in group therapy and it really helped.  Most of my group were bleeder's (cutters) so that was different since I stopped that way back.  But then I had intergrated my "bad" alternates years ago too.  Good luck.\n\nI tend to lose around 2-3 hours a day.  I have no idea what I do then and I don't really care.  I don't get in trouble by family or friends, so I see it as a small payment to be able to live the rest of the day as myself.\n\nYou don't get "alternates" from BAD DAYS you get them from being raped as a 4 and 5 year old by your dad.  And as its also caused by brain chemistry being out of alignment.  So please, don't give me this caveman shit.

Any advice on how to design a flash game? And also how to post it in the web? Thanks in advance. I would suggest starting with:\n\nhttp://www.gotoandplay.it/\n\nthis site has a lot of source files, tutorials, and an active forum.  As an experienced Flash game developer, I am consistently impressed by the site.  As far as books go, There are a variety of them out there.  \n\nI worked on one called Flash MX 2004 Game Programming (it is part of that Game Programming series).  Now that Flash 8 is out, it is a bit hard to find, but I have gotten good feedback.  Nothing is radically different about how you approach programming a game in Flash 8, you just have some access to much cooler visual capabilities.\n\nAlso, if you are interested, I write a blog at http://justin.everett-church.com and write about game development for the web and for mobile devices (Flash Lite) periodically.
female contraception? has any one got the marina ,and can u feel it and wat happened to youre periods :) I got mine a week ago.  You cant feel it at all.  There was a little cramping when it was put in and thats it.  It is easier if you have it done right after you finish your period.  It takes your body 3-6 months to adjust to it so you may spot on and off for thatr long and then after that most women stop having their period as long as they have the IUD in place.  It rocks not to have to worry about taking pills for contraception

Why is the centre of fire is blue?   A flame is the product of a highly exothermic reaction for example combustion, a self-sustaining oxidation reaction, or nuclear fusion in the sun. In layman's terms, a flame could be said to be, for example, the visible part of a fire.\n\nThe color and temperature of the flame are dependent on the type of fuel involved in the combustion. For example: when a lighter is held to a candle. This applied heat causes the fuel molecules to evaporate, in this state they can then react with oxygen, giving off enough heat in the exothermic reaction to sustain a consistent flame. The resulting increases in temperature tear apart some of the fuel molecules, forming various incomplete combustion products and free radicals. Sufficient energy in the flame will excite the electrons in these products, which results in the emission of visible light. As the combustion temperature increases, so does the energy of the electromagnetic radiation given off by the flame. This is why the hottest visible flame is in the blue/violet region of the visible spectrum.

Does America tend to fail? Americans wanted to crash Hussein, so they did. That's OK. But telling the truth their were no terrorist in Iraq under him (this fact was proved by Pentagon by the way) now US Army almost lost control of this. They now couldn't defend even diplomats in the center of Bahdad not to tell about the other part of country. Iraq is being controled by group of bandits and terrorists. Hundreds of peole die every day. World hate USA for this unjustice war. So I can see no good in future. Do you? Why? America tends to succeed--that is why world hate USA.  Also why world people want come live here reap benefits.

is this enough to get me fired? So I started a new job 3 days ago.  On the first day I filled out papers for like 3 hours and didn't do much.  Today I was filling in my hours and wanted to know what number to use for general office.  However when I asked my boss I said "what is the code for not doing anything?"  The office erupted in laughter and he gave me the number.  Do you think I will be terminated tomorrow? How big's your workload?

what is the average pay for a forensic scientist in the U.S?   Forensic Scientist ($22,000-35,000)\n\nJob Description\nForensic scientists collect and analyze evidence found at crime scenes. Specifically, they analyze blood, saliva, semen, drugs, fingerprints, and firearms and perform reconstructions on skeletal bones. Forensic scientists also confer with law enforcement personnel and attorneys on evidence collection, preserve evidence, write reports, and testify in court. The scientific analysis of evidence often proves critical in determining the innocence or guilt of a person accused of a crime. Thus, forensic scientists play a vital role in the criminal justice process.\n\nEducation\nEntry-level jobs in forensic science require a four-year degree in one of the following: biology, chemistry, physics, microbiology, genetics, or medical technology. Communication arts and law classes are considered helpful. Some crime labs also require laboratory experience.\n\nSpecial Skills\nA forensic scientist works with many different kinds of people, often under stressful circumstances. Thus, it is essential for a person in this field to have good "people" skills. Because forensic scientists must complete many reports and make court appearances, they must be capable writers and good speakers. Finally, forensic scientists must be able to manipulate tiny bits of evidence under a microscope that requires excellent hand-eye coordination.\n\nSalary and Benefits\nForensic scientists generally work for state or federal crime laboratories. Because these positions are found primarily in government, some medical and retirement benefits are paid.\nAt the state level, beginning forensic scientists are paid about $1,900 per month. Those who start with laboratory experience may receive as much as $3,000 per month. Depending on the state, experienced workers may eventually earn between $35,000 and $50,000 per year. Federal salaries are usually higher.\n\nWorking Conditions\nAs employees of the government, forensic scientists generally work 40-hour weeks. However, because of increasing caseloads and the need to meet deadlines, they may work extra hours.\nForensic scientists work primarily in the crime lab. However, they also go to the scene of the crime to examine and secure evidence, and they testify in court.\n\nOutlook\nGood forensic scientists are always in demand. However, because of pressures to reduce government funding, beginning positions are usually limited, and competition for them is keen. The job outlook in this area is, at best, fair.\n\nFor More Information\nAmerican Academy of Forensic Sciences\nP.O. Box 669\n410 North 21st St., Suite 203\nColorado Springs, CO 80901
What do you think the appropiate age for a bf is? I am 13 and my parents don't think I should have a boyfriend.  But all of my friends have or have had a boyfriend. I have to but they haven't known.

Sure go on dates but I wouldnt get to serious with a boyfriend.  \n\nGuys are way too much trouble.  \n\nIf I could go back I would wait.  Its hard though I know.  \n\nI think 16 is probably the right age.

Is this fair? A basketball player makes 50% of his shots and makes millions of dollars.  A doctor only cures a fraction of his patients and makes hundreds of thousands of dollars.  A congressman gets only a fraction of his bills passed and easily gets reelected.  George Bush makes tons of mistakes and has a low rating.  But according to the NO Child Left Behind law teachers have to have a 100% success rate with their students or be in danger of psome kind of punishent.  Is this Fair? i don't think "life's not fair" is a good enough explanation.  it's just wrong.  i think people would like to do more but feel their hands are tied.  i know i do sometimes.  it's hard as an individual to feel as though you can make a difference.  we just have to keep protesting, voting, speaking out and trying i guess.  what else can we do?
why do we do what we do and regret it later?   Humans work on behaviors. They are learned and just a part of our personality. What we need to learn is that we all have what we call "automatic thoughts". Just use an automatic thought record. That is stop recognize the quick "automatic thought" that comes to you first when posed with a situation or conversation, Think about the emotion attatched to it and then think about what you are to do next. That would be the action, what you do next. By keeping a thought record of this line of thinking, over time you will learn to catch yourself before you have a regret, be it a word that was cutting or an action. I hope that this helps. What it all boils down to is "think before you react" and understand why you feel the way you do.

Where is the place with the hugest waves ? surfing In the middle of the ocean there are huge waves. These waves don't break. They are huge swells because the depth of the ocean allow more energy and size. If you are talking in terms of surfable waves, the largest ride-able waves are either Todos Santos, Maverick's, or Peahi (aka Jaws). Of the three, I would say Peahi has the largest waves.

why does god just sit around and watch us like a tv?   People have this erroneous idea that God is some old white haired bearded man sitting in a rocking chair with nothing better to do than watch us like a hawk.\n\n#1. God is not a man and therefore does not think, act or do like humans do - and he never ages. He is not 10, 20 or 30 - he is Spirit and is ageless.\n#2. Angels are assigned to us and they keep a record of everything that goes on around us - who we deliberately offend and who offends us - if we sinned or didn't sin - and so on.\n#3. God sees to it the universe is kept in working order as well as all life (even if life exists elsewhere - he would have created it and watches over it).\n\nIf we are not fitting for the new world to come - he doesn't want us there. The New Heavens and New Earth already created and prepared awaits those who rise above his and her sinful desires, and shows themselves trustworthy and responsible.\n\nHe gave man another chance - and through Jesus is the only way to God and to salvation from the death and eternal punishment sin brings.

Water on the knees, what are the medical procedures?   You might need to go to an Orthopedic surgeon.

There are new advancements in medicine everyday, so do try a surgeon.

Who do you think is the best all time Baseball player ever, one for the ages? You can have the Arogant Bonds in there, but my personal opinion he don't rank very high The greatest baseball player of all time is the immortal Sultan of Swat, the Mighty Bambino Babe Ruth.  714 homeruns in 2503 games .342 lifetime batting average .690 lifetime slugging average 15 world series homeruns and 94 lifetime victories as a pitcher.  I'll stack those numbers against anyone.
Which one of the following frequencies of a wave in the air can be heard as an audible sound by the human ear? A: 0.10 Hz\nB: 10 Hz\nC: 1,000 Hz\nD: 100,000 Hz The correct choice is "C: 1,000 Hz."  If you go to a piano keyboard, the A below "middle C" is at 440 Hz.  Every time you jump up one octave to the next A, you double your frequency, so the A above middle C is 880 Hz, and the one above that is 1760 Hz.  Since 1000 Hz falls between those two (obviously audible) notes, it must be audible itself.\n\nIn fact, every half-step (walking up the keyboard, both black and white keys) is about 6% higher in frequency.  As it turns out, the B and C above middle C are at about 987.8 and 1046.5 Hz, respectively, so your 1000 Hz tone is between them.

Forgive a cheating boyfriend? My boyfriend of 1 year cheated on me.  He met some random girl in town for a conference at a bar, went out with her about 4-5 times in as many days, "fooled around" once and had sex with her twice.  He (of course) says he's sorry.  We were awesome friends and really close before all of this came about.  We love each other, though we prefer to say we aren't "in love" with each other - it's more like a deep caring.  He meant so much more to me as a friend than a boyfriend, and what we shared was a LOT more than just physical.  I always invisioned him in my life in someway; probably not as a spouse, but a close friend for always. (He's a few years older than me and doesn't want marriage; I, being younger, am not sure yet, but I think I do - so we always sort of knew that the romantic 'us' wouldn't be a forever thing.)  Should I forgive him and let him work to get my trust back as a friend, or move on and (try) never to think of him again? It doesn't sound like he really wants to be in a committed relationship with you. If he was serious he wouldn't have cheated. He cheated on you not once but twice, according to him. It's probably more than that like when a cop pulls over a drunk driver and they say "oh, i only had two beers". I'd say goodbye and move on. As far as going back to being platonic friends it would probably be too awkward and painful and it won't be the same as before.

The Bible Code (not the da vinci code)? I was readin the book "The Bible Code" recently and it said something about the world ending this year in a nuclear world war started by terrorists... what is your outlook on this and do any of you believe in it since it did predict WWI and WWII? There is no code. God does not keep secrets. The Bible is very Black and white. It is straight forward. Do not fall into trying to decode. That is the work of Satan.\nAs far as the war, you speak of ...YES! Watch Pastor Hagee he will explain the Bible Prophecy. He does not assume or use his own interpretation of what he imagines. He uses the Bible and explains what the Bible means. He interprets the written word in accordance to Biblical knowledge. He is very well educated. The Bible does teach us that man will destroy himself and the earth. Yes, this will occur when Iran, the Imam, uses nuclear weapons to attack Israel. The Imam believes his mission is to kill the Jews in Israel and then to kill Americans. Today, Iran has been acquiring the Nuclear weapons to complete it's believed to be mission.  China has been helping Iran for the past 2 years, to do so. The explained theory is that Imam and Iranians will first attack the Jews in Israel and then infiltrate bombs into America. God tells us to keep our eye on Israel, when the things come to pass there, as foretold, we are headed for the Holy War. The Jews are God's protected people. We are to treat them with love and respect and honor. The Bible is true. I urge people to read it. To pray and build a personal relationship with the Lord. Live to better the world. The most important thing is not that the world will end or how it ends. The most important thing is how we all live our life both now and eternally. Go forth and teach the saving message of Christ to all nations.\nAs the Bible predicts: There are wars, famine, disease, storms, earthquakes and so on throughout the world. There are social problems and people looking for peace and can not find it. There has come the time that brother against brother and so on. The US is at War in Iraq & Saudi. The US has enemies in many countires. This is a time of turbulenece. When China backs Iran and in turn Iran attcks Israel and the US this will result in a major world war.

Do you think we should stay a Republic? I am curious to know what the majority of people think.  Do you think that our current Republic (I am speaking of the USA) is a proper form of government for our country in this age? Do you see a shift coming?  If you do think that our goverment is changing or will change what type of government do you see?\nThank you. Article 4, Section 4 of the Constitution promised to every state in the union a republican form of government. Forces that opposed the concept still exist today in, I believe the ideology of the American left.\nSome speculate the work of Lincoln began the demise, others the 17th- amendment. My personal research indicates text books went from Constitutional republic and referred to America as a democracy in 1949. American Government, by Frank Magruder Ph.D.  published by Allyn and Bacon.\n\n"A pure democracy can admit no cure for the mischiefs of faction.  A \ncommon passion or interest will be felt by a majority, and there is \nnothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party.  \nHence it is, that democracies have ever been found incompatible with \npersonal security or the rights of property; and have, in general, \nbeen as short in their lives as they have been violent in thier \ndeaths." -- James Madison.\n"Democracy is four wolves and a sheep voting on dinner." -- Robert A. \nHeinlein
You know how Australians kinda sound British to Americans?Do Americans sound British to Australians? It would be nice to hear from Australians but open to any thoughts. I have several friends in Melbourne, Perth, Sydney and Brisbane, and they have no trouble at all distinguishing Americans from the British. The American accents (even regional ones like Southern, New Yorker, Bostonian, and California) are very distinct, and with the widespread viewing of American films, no one from other countries seems to have any trouble picking an American accent out from the crowd.\n\nThey may have American accents down, but could a typical Australian tell the difference between a South Afrikaan, a Kiwi (aka New Zealander), an Irish, a British, a Scottish and a Welsh accent? ;-) Come on, Aussies! Show us what you got!

Has there ever been a situation in any sport where it was to a team's benefit to lose rather then win a game? Often near the end of a season, a game is meaningless to a certain team. But does any playoff format in a sport (pro or amateur) allow the possiblility that it would be to a team's advantage to lose its last game rather than win it? If so, please explain the situation. Has this ever actually happened? If so, did that team lose on purpose, forfeit, or still try to win the game? If that were the case the Royals should be in first place by now...

Where can I find a map of the United States after the ice caps melt and the sea levels rise?   There's a map in the link below. However, it doesn't show Alaska and Hawaii. \n\nYou'll see that most of Florida and many other areas in the southeast will be underwater. If all of the ice caps melted, the oceans would rise 215 feet. Since the mean elevation of the United States is about 2500, most of the United States will still be dry. In fact, 21 states would be completely high and dry, as their lowest elevation is greater than 215 feet.\n\nColorado 3,350 feet, lowest point\nWyoming 3,099\nNew Mexico 2,842\nUtah 2,000\nMontana 1,800\nSouth Dakota 966\nNebraska 840\nNorth Dakota 750\nIdaho 710\nKansas 679\nMinnesota 600\nWisconsin 579\nMichigan 572\nIowa 480\nNevada 479\nOhio 455\nIndiana 320\nOklahoma 289\nIllinois 279\nKentucky 257\nWest Virginia 240\nMissouri 230\n\nSome things to note: ice has been melting for 18,000 years, as we are still coming out of the last ice age. At the peak of the ice age, ice volume was ~80,000,000 km3. It is now ~30,000,000 km3. So, it has taken 18,000 years to melt to melt ~50,000,000 km3 of ice. And, it would take thousands of years more to melt the remaining ~30,000,000 km3 of ice, especially when you consider most of the ice is at the very cold south pole.\n \nBy the way, the melting of this ice over the past 18,000 years has been NATURAL. In fact, at times during the past 18,000 years, the rate of ice melting has been much greater than it is now.

where is Magneto? what happen? in comics i mean. Magneto lost his powers. here is the story.\n\nWith an army of mutants at his disposal following the deadly Legacy Virus being cured, Magneto declared war on mankind. Yet again, Magneto was opposed by the X-Men, and in the ensuing clash he was severely injured by Wolverine. Recuperating, Magneto was powerless to prevent Sentinels controlled by Xavier’s genetic twin Cassandra Nova from decimating the island. Magneto was again believed dead, and after a recording purported to contain his last words was found, mutant supremicist ideals became widespread in the mutant community, with some adoring him as a martyr of the mutant cause. Magneto seemingly returned with a vengeance, infiltrating the Xavier Institute as the mutant healer Xorn, co-opting the Special Class as his new Brotherhood, and launching an attack on Manhattan. Killing Jean Grey before being killed in turn by Wolverine, it was later revealed that this Magneto was an imposter. The true Magneto was still in Genosha, where he joined Xavier in rebuilding the shattered nation. Following the dissolution of the Avengers after the Scarlet Witch suffered an apparent breakdown, Magneto rushed to her aid. When the X-Men and a new Avengers team met to discuss her fate, it seemed as though Magneto coerced her into altering reality, creating a world where mutants were the dominant species and lived openly without fear with himself as ruler. It was later revealed that Magneto's son Quicksilver was the one who actually convinced the Scarlet Witch to alter reality, in an attempt to appease their father, as well as the X-Men and Avengers who threatened to put the Scarlet Witch down. \n\nFollowing the events of "M-Day," Magneto has apparently lost his mutant powers. Rather than kill him, Wolverine decided to let him live the rest of his life as the thing he hates the most... a human.
Have You Read "Atheism, The Case Against 'God'"? p2? I wanted do answer 'brokentogether' who asked in return if I read The Case for Christ, written by Lee Strobel.\nYes I have, when I began my bible study I wanted sources far and wide. \n\nTo be honest, I was disappointed by this Strobel, he came across like an Elementary school teacher reading to children about Santa.  His methods were similar to the way Jehovahs Witnesses speak.  Something like "when i read that passage from Paul I felt it was awe inspiring, how could this not be true??!!"  Hardly convincing. lol, i read the case for christ too. \ni stopped at about 45 inaccurate conclusions. \ni try to get my kids (i'm a teacher) to understand exactly how to draw conclusions from evidence. how you can only tell what MUST be true as opposed to what MAY be true. this guy simply jumps too far in his conclusions. its not logical in the least. \ni had a really hard time believing that the guy was a journalist. \n\nbut it was an easy read. won't change an atheist's mind though since there's nothing particularly convincing in it.

How did Progressivism contrast with the ideas of the Founding Fathers? This is in the Pre-War Era, 1890 to 1912.  More specifically, How was Progressivism and the reforms it sought a departure from the political and economical ideas of the Founders such as Jefferson and Madison? The Founders were wealthy, well-educated, land-owning white men, and their political and economic views reflect that. The constitution is essentially a prescription for keeping power in that select group, and looking at the world today, was very successful in its aim.\n\nProgressivism differed in that it sought to empower and protect people outside the select class, specifically poor people and immigrants. Of course, both groups--the progressives and the founders--sought to empower themselves. The difference is that the progressives were poor while the founders were rich.
for girls only? ive got a fetish for pregnant women and feet, is this weird I'm a guy and I'm going to answer this anyway.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with it. A lot of people have fetishes. Personally I love women's feet (nice ones of course). I know another guy that finds pregnant women sexy. There is nothing weird about that. The only downside to the pregnant thing is most pregnant women will not have sex with you unless you got them that way so you'll just be looking and wishing.\n\nWow reading all these answers I had to come back and comment more. What idiots! Don't listen to them. They have no idea what fun is. They're too uptight. My girlfriend loves that I love her feet and gets very turned on when I rub them. And Brainyguy has no brains. F'em!
Where do General Ledger codes from from? Where do General Ledger codes from from? Is there a central list of them somewhere? I am from the "old school accounting era".  General Ledger Codes? I am not familiar with; however, "General Ledger Accounts derive from the accounting basics.\n100 - Assets\n200 - Liabilities\n300 - Owner's Equity\n400 - Income\n500 - Expenses\n\n- adding zeros to the basics expands the number of for the groups\n- i.e., an asset account for a piece of office furniure could simply be 100.001 - Office Furniture-Desk\n- i.e., an asset account for Office Supplies could be 100.201-Office Supplies\n- i.e., a liability account for accrued utilities could be 200.010-Utilities Payable\n\nThe purpose for the ledger accounts is to post related transactions to the same account and if by chance you need to audit transactions, the ledger account numbers allows easy tracking from the General Journal to the Ledger Accounts and "subsidiary accounts" if any. **Have a web site that needs traffic?

Is Matt Dillon the actor gay? A friend from NYC says he is and so is Keanu.?   Unless your friend has slept with Matt and Keanu, you shouldn't listen to him. And tell him that he gossips like a woman.
how many of you would have a borning life  without your computer?   Oh, love this question.  It's like 10:30 so I think that tells you my answer. ;)\n No but really, I'd have a very different life, that's for sure.  Much more reading, for sure.  Maybe it wouldn't be boring.  Maybe it would be more interesting.  I'll see.  As of tomorrow I'm not going to use the compurter for a week.  Thanks for giving me the idea and I'll update this if it is still open or something to tell you what it will be like.
Okay whats more annoying, a jerk who answers your question or a prat who takes things WAAAY too seriously?   it depends.... whose the jerk by the way?
Mars magnetic field? Dose mars have a magnetic fleld? How many planets have magnetic fields? (I know earth jupiter and so and so has them.) It does, although it is pretty weak.  The magnetic field depends on the rotation of the planet's metal core.  That's what creates the field. \n\nThe other planets with magnetic fields include: Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\n\nIf a planet doesn't have a rotating core of metal, it will not have a magnetic field, such as Pluto.
history of great kills park?   Great Kills is the name of a neighborhood within New York City's borough of Staten Island. It is located on the island's South Shore, and according to many local geographers, it is the South Shore's northernmost community. Kill is an archaic Dutch word with various popular translations, including "creek" and "channel;" indeed, many small streams dot the neighborhood, and the name can be interpreted as meaning that a great number of such streams can be found there.\n\nThe eastern half of what is today known as Great Kills was originally named Cairedon, while the western half was referred to as Newtown. Later, both came to be known by the single name of Giffords, after Daniel Gifford, a local commissioner and road surveyor — this name surviving in Giffords Lane, the main north-south thoroughfare in what was formerly called Newtown; the Great Kills station on the Staten Island Railway is at the southern end of this street, in the heart of the community's business district. The present name of Great Kills was informally adopted in 1865. Another former place name associated with the area is Honeywood; its precise origin is uncertain, but it was the name of the telephone exchange that served Great Kills and many other upper South Shore communities from the 1920s through the late 1950s.\n\nAt the southeastern corner of the neighborhood is the Staten Island Unit of the Gateway National Recreation Area, which was formerly known as Great Kills Park, and is often still referred to as such by Staten Islanders today. Immediately to the west of this is a harbor and marina, home of the Great Kills Yacht Club. Many hotels and highly-acclaimed seafood restaurants once dominated the shoreline, but steadily increasing pollution of the nearby waters forced most of them out of business by the middle of the 20th Century; the last surviving shoreline restaurant of note, the Shoals Restaurant, was destroyed in a 1968 arson fire, which also claimed the life of an elderly caretaker who had been living on the premises.\n\nLike many other Staten Island neighborhoods, Great Kills experienced massive population growth in the latter third of the 20th Century, largely catalyzed by the opening of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge providing easy access from Brooklyn in November of 1964. Many of the new arrivals have been Italian-Americans, and today they constitute the neighborhood's largest ethnic group.\n\nA small city park — named Crescent Beach Park, alluding to the crescent-shaped harbor formed by the peninsula at the south end of the Gateway National Recreation Area — stands at the southeastern corner of the neighborhood. On September 1, 2003 this park was the scene of an alleged hate crime when a visiting African-American girl, her mother and some of her friends became involved in an altercation with some local youths, which turned violent. Eleven neighborhood youths were ultimately indicted on assault and related charges — an incident which underscored the often hostile relations between African-Americans and Italian-Americans in New York City (and many other American cities east of the Mississippi River) that have prevailed since the mid-1960s.\n\nHylan Boulevard between Nelson Avenue and Richmond Avenue has become one of the island's busiest commercial strips; approximately one mile long, the northeastern half of this strip is considered part of Great Kills while the southwestern half is deemed to be in the adjacent "town" of Eltingville. Likewise, another border between Great Kills and Eltingville is Armstrong Avenue, with Great Kills on the eastern side of this north-south road.\n\nThe ZIP Code for Great Kills is 10308, and actor Rick Schroder lived in the community as a child

Why do they allow people like Michael Bloomberg to buy their way into office.? He spent $87 million in the first election and $84 to secure his second term. And he's a two faced liar! I am afraid that is going to happen in Michigan governers race this year. Dick Devos (Amway) started to run TV adds two months ago. So far he has kept it clean but I look for him to buy himself a governers office. Sad part is he is another rich repuglican. I am afraid where Michigan will go with him in charge.
what is the mined geologic disposal plan?   When a fuel assembly has been used in a power plant, the assembly is replaced and the old one stored under water in special ponds, or in dry concrete structures or casks.  Here, shielded from people, it is allowed to cool.\n\nAfter being sufficiently cooled, the assembly, along with others, is put into a cask for temporary storage on the nuclear power plant site.  Delaying the final disposal of high-level waste also allows its radioactivity to decay.  Forty years after removal from the reactor, less than one thousandth of its initial radioactivity remains, and it is much easier to handle.\n\nThe ultimate disposal of vitrified wastes, or of spent fuel assemblies without reprocessing, requires their isolation from the environment for long periods.  The most favored method is burial in dry, stable geological formations up to 600 m or more deep.  Several countries are investigating sites that would be technically and publicly acceptable.\n\nThe U.S. considered a number of options for high-level waste disposal, and decided that mined geologic disposal offered the best option for isolation, although research on transmutation of long-lived radionuclides is continuing.  Transmutation involving neutron bombardment has the theoretical possibility of removing isotopes that are radioactive for a long time, thus alleviating disposal issues.\n\nThe plan is that the fuel will eventually be placed in the geologic deep-level repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.  This is a mountain of "tuff" -- stable volcanic rock.  This site was selected after years of investigation into other rock forms including granite, layered-salt, salt domes, and basalt.  All had advantages and all would have provided satisfactory final disposal for high level wastes.  The selection of the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada was an expeditious choice based upon the political realities of the day.\n\nThe repository deep in Yucca Mountain will consist of a large number of tunnels or corridors into which the spent fuel will be placed, in the form of fuel rods.  These rods will be sealed in heavy casks of steel, and placed in the mined caverns, which are then sealed with bentonite (a clay that forms a secure seal).  The pictures below show what the repository could look like.\n\nArtist's conception of repository underground facilities and operations\n\nArtist's conception of repository facilities\nHowever, Regulatory bodies have not yet formally approved Yucca Mountain as a high-level waste repository.  Also, Congress has not adequately funded the work, even though all necessary funds have already been collected in the Nuclear Waste Fund as a surcharge on the use of electricity (at 0.1 cent per kWh - for a total of $16 billion).  So, in the meantime, used fuel assemblies are stored temporarily at the power plants in water pools or large dry casks cooled by natural convection.\n\n\nTransuranic Waste\n\nWastes arising from weapons production in the Cold War have their own repository at the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP) in New Mexico.  This is a repository constructed in layered salt formations and it is been in operation since late 1999, accepting wastes from Government weapons production sites.  The wastes stored there are presently mainly transuranic wastes.  This waste has no connection with commercial electricity generation from the nuclear option.

Was Roberto Duran really going to keep fighting? Duran was fifty years old when he fought Hector Camacho in 2001. Afterwards, he was injured in a car accident and recovered too slowly to get back in shape for another fight. But would he really have gotten back in the ring anyway? During his entrance for the Camacho fight, he was dancing and making everything out of it like he knew then that it would be his last fight.\n\n(Happy birthday, Roberto!) Yes it seems MANOS DE PIEDRA goes through his money like \nwater through a grate.The dancing etc before fighting Camacho\nwas Roberto just bigging himself up for more big money fights.He\nis a TRUE legend and shouldn't box anymore.

What is the best way to get management experience without working in retail? I have 6 years of admin experience in real estate and I'm looking to get out of field. I'm planning on going back to school for my BS in Business Management and want to get some experience in mgmt.  Can you get this experience without working in retail? Yes.  You can get management experience working in ANY field.\n\nThink about it - whatever job you have, you have a manager, right?  How do you think that person got the job?  By first having your job and being promoted.\n\nSo, get a regular old job, preferably at a business that's growing fast, and work hard at it.  Don't goof off like the other employees.  Act responsible and help the more junior/newer employees when they don't know how to do something.  This will mark you apart from your co-workers as someone who can handle the responsibilities of management, and you'll probably soon be trained into an assistant manager position, and from there, you'll be gaining management experience.

What are you thinking about Marco van Basten and his "white Flying Dutchmen" is that little bit of rasism ?   I know nothing whatever of Marco van Basten, but I will point out that not every reference to skin color is, all by itself, racism.  Also, it's at least a little silly, since most Dutchmen are white.

Mormons can they drink De-Caff? Can mormons drink de-caff,what can and cant they drink? There are no strictly set rules. The Word of Wisdom says "hot drinks are not for the belly or the body" and we have been told that this means coffee and tea. However, we don't know whether this is indeed because of the caffeine, we just know that we are not supposed to drink coffee and tea. So no, we wouldn't drink de-caff either. And I do drink coke and eat chocolate, even though those contain caffeine.\n\nThe Word of Wisdom isn't just about what we can't do. It is an entire health plan which says that we shouldn't drink tea or coffee, shouldn't smoke or chew tobbaco, shouldn't drink alcohol or take harmful drugs, and should eat meat sparingly and eat lots of whole grains and vegetables. What is amazing is that this revelation was given in 1833, in an age where people still thought that vegetables were an inferior food to meat and smoking was good for the heart. And no one knew anything about caffeine or mouth and lung cancer.\n\nMormons who live the Word of Wisdom live an average of ten years longer than the general population. (OK, who said "It just feels like longer"??!?)
Is a St. Christopher medal necklace too boyish? I am getting married in August we both have children (him a 7 year old boy, me a 8 year old girl).  We are getting them both a gift when we get married.  We are pretty religious and was thinking a St Christopher medal would be a really nice gift that they can keep into adulthood, with their name and our wedding date engraved on back.  I want to get them the same thing or similar in idea.  Is a St. Christopher medal necklace too boyish for my 8 year old daughter as a gift to her on our wedding day?  We though about a cross for my daughter but not enough room to engrave her name and the date on it.  Any ideas? a St. Christopher 's necklace is no too   " boyish" for a girl, she'll keep it and cherish it forever

I have completed B.E Telecom in Pak. Should I work in industry or go for a Master degree from uk?   It depends upon your interest. If you love to study further then it is the best option, because here in Pakistan as far as industry is concerned no innovative work is being done in almost all areas (except Militry and Defence). If you choose to work in industry then you are only going to maintain the apparatus already innovated, there is nothing technical in it. However, if you love to enhance your technicalities and importance then it is better for you to go abroad.

How do I find out my daughters school local ranking? I want to enroll my soon to be three year old in pre-school. I want to send her to a good school because I don't want to have to keep moving her from school to school after I find things out about the school. Is there a website I can go on that will tell me the school local and national ranking along with test scores and stuff. Your state should have a Department of Education. Go to their website. It should provide information about every school in the state, including testing scores for previous years, demographics, and rankings.
Did AIDS really...? originate from monkeys? It's very likely that it passed to humans via monkeys (or other apes/primates) -- but it probably didn't "originate" there.  Indications are that forms of the AIDS virus have been around for a very long time -- it's just that the virus recently evolved to be able to infect humans.
what team will kill the aussie fairytale? And what will they take from the game?\n\nHave the aussies arrived as a real contender for the world game? I believe, and i may be a little optomistic, that Australia will make the 2nd round (maybe with a draw against Croatia). Don't get me wrong, Croatia is very good, but their team isn't as good as previous world cup campaigns.\n\nIn the 2nd round, they will play Italy (Czech Republic will top group E) and they will lose for the simple fact that Italy, while not performing well in the past few tournaments by their standards, will have a technical and tactics supremecy. I think Totti, Italy's play-maker, will destroy Australia.\n\nThe reason why Australia will be a better team then they were before is:\n1. The Australian Governing Body, Football Australia, is much more professional and well organised then before.\n2. They are now going to be part of the Asian qualifying groups, which is, in my opinion, easier to get out of the their present system, meaning regular competition and regular World Cup's, which means constant improvement.\n\nHope this answer helps and wasn't too long-winded.
what are jets and sprites above earth's highest clouds?   Characteristics of Red Sprites\n\nSprites are massive but weak luminous flashes that appear directly above an active thunderstorm system and are coincident with cloud-to-ground or intracloud lightning strokes. Their spatial structures range from small single or multiple vertically elongated spots, to spots with faint extrusions above and below, to bright groupings which extend from the cloud tops to altitudes up to about 95 km. Sprites are predominantly red. The brightest region lies in the altitude range 65-75 km, above which there is often a faint red glow or wispy structure that extends to about 90 km. Below the bright red region, blue tendril-like filamentary structures often extend downward to as low as 40 km. Sprites rarely appear singly, usually occurring in clusters of two, three or more. Some of the very large events, such as shown in Figure 1, seem to be tightly packed clusters of many individual sprites. Other events are more loosely packed and may extend across horizontal distances of 50 km or more and occupy atmospheric volumes in excess of 10,000 cubic km. \n\nHigh speed photometer measurements show that the duration of sprites is only a few ms. Current evidence strongly suggests that sprites preferentially occur in decaying portions of thunderstorms and are correlated with large positive cloud-to-ground lightning strokes. The optical intensity of sprite clusters, estimated by comparison with tabulated stellar intensities, is comparable to a moderately bright auroral arc. The optical energy is roughly 10-50 kJ per event, with a corresponding optical power of 5-25 MW. Assuming that optical energy constitutes 1/1000 of the total for the event, the energy and power are on the order of 10-100 MJ and 5-50 GW, respectively.\n\nIf sprites are only barely detectable by the unaided human eye, in intensified television images obtained from the ground and from aircraft they appear as dazzlingly complex structures that assume a variety of forms\n\nCharacteristics of Blue Jets\n\nBlue jets are a second high altitude optical phenomenon, distinct from sprites, observed above thunderstorms using low light television systems. As their name implies, blue jets are optical ejections from the top of the electrically active core regions of thunderstorms. Following their emergence from the top of the thundercloud, they typically propagate upward in narrow cones of about 15 degrees full width at vertical speeds of roughly 100 km/s (Mach 300), fanning out and disappearing at heights of about 40-50 km. Their intensities are on the order of 800 kR near the base, decreasing to about 10 kR near the upper terminus. These correspond to an estimated optical energy of about 4 kJ, a total energy of about 30 MJ, and an energy density on the order of a few mJ/m^3. Blue jets are not aligned with the local magnetic field.

Can this generation afford a new home? I am thinking of leaving California because it is in possible to afford a house. Is there any helfull real estate companies that help first time buys in California. well just wait because house prices can move like stocks do..look at a chart of some home building stocks like LEN, KBH, TOL...up for a long time then down....housing can be cyclical , so watch houses on the market where you want to live...notice that they sit around not selling and the owner's remodels soemthing or lowers his selling price...and it still sits..and he lowers again a month later...so the longer you sit the better deal you are potentially getting..and notice around this house many more for sale and they start lowering too...it is like everyone wants to sell and needs to sell...so wait and eventually they will sell to you at a price close to what you can afford....RE can drop in price slowly fro long periods of time..look at Tokyo RE prices 1989-2000.........
where did the name jehovah come from?   Is the personal name of God.  Later, some Christian translators mistakenly combined the vowels of “Adonay” with the consonants of “YHWH” producing the word “YaHoWaH.” When the Scriptures were translated into German during the Reformation, the word was transliterated into the German pronunciation, which pronounces “Y” as an English “J” and pronounces “W” as an English “V” — or “Jahovah.” Then in the early 17th century when the Scriptures were being translated into English with the help of some of the German translations, the word was again transliterated as “Jehovah,” and this this unfortunate accident has carried over into many modern English translations.\n\nHebrew YAHWEH

This was about 12 years after world population reached five billion, in 1987. However, given that the population of some countries, such as Nigeria, is not even known to the nearest million, such precise timings are essentially meaningless.

Should I be angry with my husband? We have been married for almost 2 years and together almost 4.  I grew up an only child and very independent. My husband claims to be independent but his mother is very controling and ALWAYS did things for both the boys, especially him since he was the youngest of the two.  So his independence is nothing like mine. I love him dearly but he constantly involves his mother in our financial status and asks her for help when we need it. I understand that being young and married (and in school) can be hard but I just want both of us to have control over our lives. When she gets involved, all control goes to her and my husband and I fight about that.  He thinks that there is nothing wrong with it but I feel like I am just his roomate who happens to share a bank account. I hate getting mad at him but not talking to me about and involving his mother does not help. I am all about communication. We are both 23 and I feel that we should be dependent only on each other. Am I wrong for being upse No you are not wrong to be upset!  Those are your feelings!

Does anyone have long toes ? The overall length of my foot is 23 cm, the length of my second toe is 5 cm. Is there an anatomical standard for this comparison? dang I thought I had long toes.. my 2nd is only 1 1/2 inches .. I think thats just shy of 4 cm but I'm not that good at conversions. there is no standard foot or toe size.. some people have long skinny toes others have short stubs... Its nothing to worry over, but see a doctor if you are  frequently feeling uncomfortable
Why are Australia's colors in the World Cup green and yellow and not the colors on their flag?   Well I have read all the responses so far and I must say that some are very amusing, but so far only one of these is close.  That is this one:  ( the real answer is at the bottom please read on.)\n\nGreen and gold are the national colours of Australia, as proclaimed by Sir Ninian Stephen, the Governor General of Australia on 19 April 1984. The exact colours were specified as being Pantone Matching System numbers 116C and 348C. Green and gold are also the traditional team colours of Australian national sporting teams. Nearly every current Australian national sports teams wears "The Green and Gold", although the hues and proportions of the two colours may vary between teams and across eras. It is widely believed that the colours were chosen because they are the dominant colours of Australia's floral emblem, the Golden Wattle.\n\nYou will find that every major Australian national team wears green and gold including most notably the two time world champion Wallabies of Rugby, the Socceroos of the World Cup, and the Olympic team. \n\nSource(s):\n\nwikipedia.org \n+++++ \n\nReal Answer:\nThe official colours of Australia are BLUE AND GOLD... (Not Green and Gold, Green and Yellow, or any other colours of the rainbow or anything else that the so called greenies or hippies or even other minority group may wish to conjure up.  If you go to Parliment House and read the constitution ( not that many of obviously have or have the ability to) you will find amongst the small print that the national colours for the reprsentaion of this great land of ours called Australia are Blue and Gold... the reason that we portray Green and Gold is for our sporting teams and that is due to the above mentioned clours of the Wattle flower and tree. \n\nNow before you so called experts try to smack me down with all your references and alke I suggest you visit the National Capitol and see the constitution for yourself. Also take the time to read it (if your able to that is  and you will no doubt see that I am correct and you are misinformed..) \n\nI hope that this had shed a bit of light on your dilemma or at least given more ammunition for a good arguement as I really do enjoy that..
What do you do when a relative of your husband approaches you in a sexual manor? On Father's Day of last year, my husband and I went to a Father's Day dinner at his aunts house.  He left with a few of the other dad's to ride their motorcycles while I stayed with the mothers and the children.  Unfortunately, I had to work that day and I was rather tired.  I went to lay in one of the childrens rooms with a couple of the little children that were already asleep.  While I was sleeping, I was awaken by someone rubbing my shoulders and stroking my hair.  I thought it was my daughter because she does that from time to time.  Well I went to sit up and saw that it was not my daughter, but my husbands cousin.  I jumped up and started cursing her because SHE made me rather uncomfortable.  She goes on to tell me that she has been wanting me since she first met me, while my husband and I were just dating (12 years ago).  She also tried to go on about what she wanted to do to me.  This is my hubbys family and I am not comfortable around her.  What do I do? you have been open with her that you do not want her attention.  you might let your husband know about it so he is aware of what happened but not push it further.  she most likely will leave you alone from now on, give it a chance. if she doesnt, stay away from where she is going to be if she makes you uncomfortable.

what size trolling motor do i need to get the thrust of a 3 hp gas outboard? i found a 37 ft/lb troling motor cheap and was wondering if it would be strong enough to push my 16ft canoe. Yes, that will be plenty big enough to push your canoe.  A lot quieter than the outboard too.  But, take a paddle in case your battery dies.

Can someone please tell me the exact procedure for participating in the Olympics? Do you have to be part of a team in your country or can individuals sign up?  And how can you sign up? For the most part you are representing a country so you have to be a citizen of that country.  From what I know to make an Olympic team as a participant on a team sport, like basketball or hockey, you are invited to tryouts and the coaches choose from that group, who go to the Olympics.  For individual sports such as track and field, skiing, figure skating, and others there are Olympic trials where the top two or three finishers in each event make the team.

win did president Mirabeu B, Lamar move the capital of texas frome houston to austin?   As far as I could figure out, Houston was never the capital of Texas. Austin was originally settled in 1835 and used to be called Waterloo. In 1839, Mirabeu B. Lamar renamed the city to 'Austin' in honor of Stephen F. Austin, the "father of Texas", who negotiated a peace treaty with the local Indians at the site of the present day Treaty Oak after several settlers were killed in raids. At the same time, the city was also chosen to be the capital of Texas.
Why would anyone say our soldiers died for nothing? They have given their lives for others freedom. That to me is everything. Anyone who knows me, knows to never, ever say anything derogatory about these young men and women in my presence, regardless of how they feel about the war. They are my brothers and sisters. Yes, there have been abuses and errors, and those need to be investigated and any violators appropriately punished. But by far the vast majority of our military personnel are professional, dedicated and just. \n\nEveryone dies eventually, but some get to die fighting for something in which they believe. To detract from this honorable death by saying they "died for nothing" is, IMHO, virtually unforgiveable. Does the person who dies in a hospital bed from some incurable disease "die for nothing?"

How can I find names of sailors onboard USS Molala ATF 106 in year 1975? Looking for my Navy friends and can't remember all their names go to www.google.ca or www.yahoo.com and type in "sailors, USS Molala ATF, 1975" ... continue to narrow down the search as much as you can with information you get from the results of the search.. for example, a resulting webpage might give you the names of one or two of your Navy colleagues, so in your next search, use the original search information you provided and add the names of those people until you get the information you're looking for!
Which party is the most lenient to criminals, and why? This question is based on unwanted illegal immigration! Democrats without a doubt. They owe favors to the big corporations so they do what they tell them.\n\nI don't care for the other party neither. But dollar for dollar-the Democrats are the greediest and most selfish who think more about themselves and not others

what about the idea that there is no such thing as universe? about 500 yr back we thought earth was flat\ncan the current universe/solar system be a misconception.\nlike in MIB There is a scientific theory that our "universe" is in a larger multiverse.  Though there is no way to prove either way at this point.
is this just me? sometimes when i have my eyes close, i blink. but my eye doesnt open up at all, not even a little bit. is this just me? and if not why does this happen? Blinking is to distribute fluid over the cornea.\nYour eye is a little moist ball and the part that touches air slowly dries.\nYour eye doesn't like being dry, you don't either it hurts.\nSo you have a build in eyemoistdistributor.\nThe body is a wonderful creation and an amazing design everything has a purpose.\nOh and you're not alone most people even blink when they're sleeping and without opening their eye.\nThis system is designed to be fully automated and continue even when asleep.

Do any Ivy League offer scholarships to foreign students ? What are the chances of getting such scholarships? My son has a brilliant academic record (has moved from India to Singapore to do his A level on a Government of Singapore scholarship), has over 100 hours of community service, has published articles in the largest circulated English newspaper in India, has been Vice President of the students council, has been actively participating in debates etc. He is looking forward to a course in liberal arts in the U.S. He has already taken the SAT and is hoing to get about 2300. There are tons of scholarships that go unclaimed each year. Many $400, $500 or $1000 scholarships never even get applied for because people think it's chump change and not worth applying for. Well, get a few of those $500 scholarships and it'll really make a dent in your tuition bill.\n\nDo a search on scholarships, search your major, your ethnic heritage, your town, your parents employers, your employer, hobbies, high school, local chamber of commerce/rotary/ lion's club etc. Left-handed? There is a scholarship out there for you! Older woman returning to school? There are scholarships out there for you. Do combined searches on more than one criteria "hispanic women aviation scholarships" etc.\n\nGo to the library and ask the reference librarian for a reference book on scholarships. They usually have more than one. There are all kinds of scholarships out there, you just have to start applying yourself and make it your summer career to send out letters everyday for scholarships. Good luck!
Who else thinks this Miami/Terrorist thing is just another political strategy by the Bushies? It's all we're hearing about...\nTerrorists from Miami were trying to blow up the Sears Tower...\nbut it sounds like these guys were set up or like it was some kind of entrapment...\n\nIf they were really trying to commit an act of terrorism, then I'm glad they got caught...\nBut if they weren't then I'm ashamed of being from Florida.\n\nYour thoughts? I'd like to think not, but I don't trust anything they do or say anymore.  I held off on believing it was actually Zarqawi until there was a ton of evidence.   \n\nIt's sad, but they've lied so many times that they're going to have to have a TON of evidence before I believe it was an honest threat.\n\nLet's face facts, Karl Rove is back, and suddenly, we're going to be attacked.  While he was in hiding over his treasonous acts, you'll note that nothing like this EVER came out.  He comes back, and here we go again!
How do I find out if a doctor in Texas has been sued for malpractice before?   Well you could search his name in all of the courthouses around the area where he practices, but you need to keep in mind that few doctors haven't been sued for malpractice.  You need to look at the circumstances of the suit, not just weather he/she was sued or not.

And babies are pretty slippery when you try to bath 'em .........

Why do people call acting like a real person instead of a minstrel character "acting white"? Blue blazes I'm so sick of being labeled an "oreo" simply because I act like a real person instead of a one-dimensional stereotype. Heaven forbid a black person think for themself instead having "liberals" tell them what to think or like something else other than hip-hop or menthol cigarettes! So much for the "civil rights" movement. I wish hip-hop and those crappy UPN shows would just die because it's just a modern day minstrel show that makes Amos N' Andy look progressive and brainwashes black kids into thinking this is how they should think and behave, portraying a distorted idea and definition  of "blackness". Ironically enough the stuff that actually is racist and smutty is the material that doesn't slide by the censors. I just had this conversation with somebody on another board.  Let me cross post it.  BTW- I believe you are correct.\n\nI care about people, not color, and I hear what you are saying.  So anyway, this is a reply to a person that was playing that race card...\n\n\nThe angry black thing doesn’t work for me Belinda. \n\nMy mother’s boss, Head of personel for NIH was a black woman. She died a couple of years ago of breast cancer. My parents (who are in their late 70's still keep track, and visit her husband). My boss is black. I think the world of the guy. The manager of the help desk where I work, and I work for a mult-billion dollar a year company, is a black woman. She has 25 employees. \n\nSo you want to talk entertainment? And no “Superfly” crap. The father on “Fresh prince of Belaire”, a judge. Aldus Huxley. James Earl Jones. Oprah, remember her? \n\nBlack Americans are moving into positions of power. Mayors, Congress, Supreme Court, Generals, Admirals. \n\nAnd no, I am not discounting the drug problem, crime rate, and prison population. I hear you on those. \n\nBut, Belinda, you don’t want me, whitebread boy, to solve those for you. That makes me either the liberal or conservative solution you were talking about. \n\nThe best I can personally do, is come up and greet you, look you in the eye, and shake your hand, or hug you, and not really care about the color of your skin. All I can do is accept you as an equal, and I do. \n\nThe rest, well, up to you folks to figure out the answers it would seem. You sure do not want whitebread doing it. We have screwed up enough already.
Are old SOURCE mags from the 90's worth anything?   No, you need at least 30 years before magazines start gaining value.
what is nh3-n/tkn? IT IS SOME TYPE OF CHEMICAL USED IN WATER TREATMENT Definition for NH3-N\nAmmonia Nitrogen - an inorganic, dissolved form of nitrogen that can be found in water, but in the presence of oxygen will convert to nitrate.\n\nAmmonia (NH3-N) \nan inorganic form of nitrogen, is contained in fertilizers, septic system effluent, and animal wastes. It is also a product of bacterial decomposition of organic matter. Ammonia NH3-N (NH3-N) becomes a concern if high levels of the un-ionized form are present. In this form NH3-N can be toxic to aquatic organisms. The presence of un-ionized ammonia is a function of the NH3-N concentration, pH, and temperature. Conversion of NH3-N to nitrite nitrogen by nitrification requires large quantities of oxygen which can kill aquatic organisms due to the lowered dissolved oxygen concentrations in water. NH3-N concentrations are reported in mg/L NH3-N.
i cont continue my sex more than 1 or 2 Min's...how can i full fill my wife....?   Best Answer - Chosen by Asker\n\nTry what they call Kegel exercises. They are easy to do and you can do them anywhere without anyone knowing.\n1) Try to contract the muscles you would use to stop urinating. You should feel your pelvic muscles squeezing your urethra and anus. If your stomach or buttocks muscles tighten, you are not exercising the right muscles.\n2) Once you've found the right way to contract the pelvic muscles, squeeze for 3 seconds and then relax for 3 seconds.\n3) Repeat this exercise 10 to 15 times per session. Try to do this at least 3 times a day. Kegel exercises are only effective when done regularly. Do these for awhile and you will see a big change in your performance and your own orgasms. Good Luck!!!!\n\nSource(s):\nBOOOYA!!!!\n\nAsker's Rating:\nThanks... more please...

Creationists, why is evolution wrong.  I will read all answers. So will other evolutionists.? If you have something besides Genesis quotes we've read them, some evidence of the microscopes that have looked at chimpanzee DNA that these microscopes were all busted,  some evidence that all the fossils of australopithicus was faked, \n\nwe are awaiting your very intelligent responses. <Just thinking out loud here>  It's funny how some people have the answers to their questions, because these questions have been asked before a million times by the same asker. It seems to me that the asker just doesn't want to hear what a certain group of people have to say. It's fine, but why ask if it's been answered before, is it because the answer wasn't unto their liking? I think people should ask themselves, do they want an answer or are they spending their life trying to trip others that have a mustard seed of faith up? Does it really matter was Creationist think if you are not truly interested in what they think? <Again, just thinking out loud here and grabbing two points along the way>
